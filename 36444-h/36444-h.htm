<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> New Testament is the outgrowth and development of
the Old. There is no revelation in the gospels or the epistles
which is not in its essence contained in the elder Scripture;
though to make it manifest required the incarnation of God's
Son and the descent of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, to understand
the New Testament it is necessary to study the Old
Testament. We cannot appreciate Matthew's point of view
of Christ as the Messiah until we have looked upon the throne
of David, and Solomon in all his glory; the theology of Paul
is blind until read in the light of Moses and Isaiah; and Hebrews
will obtain a new meaning when placed side by side
with Leviticus. Every chapter in the New Testament has its
references to parallel passages in the Old Testament.</p>

<p>When we open the Old Testament we find it, first of all, a
book of history. We are apt to look upon the Bible as a
dictionary of doctrine, wherein we are to search for sentences
as proof-texts. But instead it contains the story of redemption
in the form of a history. We see how God chose a family
and pruned off its dead branches and caused it to grow
into a nation; then, how he trained and disciplined that nation
through fifteen centuries, until upon it blossomed the
Divine Man. The history of the Bible is the history of humanity,
of literature, of ethics, of religion, of doctrine; and
no one who studies it carefully will fail of an abundant reward
for his endeavor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>In most works upon Bible history the purpose of the author
seems to be merely to arrange in chronological order a series
of events without much regard to their importance or their
relations to each other. The successive reigns of kings, the
chronicles of courts, the reports of battles form the contents
of most histories, whether sacred or secular. Works like these
have their value in the statement of those facts which form
the basis and working material of history. But mere facts
chronologically arranged do not constitute a history, any
more than words alphabetically arranged constitute a literature.
True history records processes, the relation of cause
and effect, the formative influences and their result in national
life. The true history of England shows not annals of kings
and achievements of warriors, but the development of a mighty
people. The true history of Greece gives the secret springs
of that intense activity which in two centuries called forth
more great men in more departments of life than all the rest
of the world could produce in a thousand years. The true
history of Israel&mdash;which is the history of the Old Testament&mdash;shows
how a little people in their mountain-eyrie grew up to
a destiny more glorious than that of the proudest empire of
all the earth, the honor of giving religion to mankind.</p>

<p>The aim of this little book is to present the outlines of that
remarkable history of the chosen people. What their mission
was, how they were trained for it, and how the world was prepared
to receive it together constitute the three threads woven
together in this work. It is a book of outlines to be studied,
not of chapters to be read. The reader will doubtless find the
paragraphs somewhat disconnected, but we trust that the
student may receive from them suggestions for thought.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this book many works have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
read and examined; but it is not my purpose to give a catalogue
of them. I would name, however, a very few books
which will be of service to the student, and will be almost a
necessity for the teacher who expects to use these outlines in
the class, for one secret of successful teaching is for the teacher
to have at his command a fund of knowledge vastly greater
than that contained in the text-book. For this purpose the
following works are named, none of which are too abstruse or
difficult for the average reader:</p>

<p>1. <i>Outline of Bible History.</i> Bishop J. F. Hurst. A small
book, containing merely the facts of the subject.</p>

<p>2. <i>Old Testament History.</i> William Smith. A larger work
and valuable, but ending with the Old Testament canon. An
additional chapter on the interval between Old and New
Testament history would greatly improve the book.</p>

<p>3. <i>Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church.</i> Dean A.
P. Stanley. Three large volumes, in a brilliant but diffuse
style, advanced to the knowledge of twenty years ago; not
altogether sound in its critical point of view, yet to be read
by all who would understand the subject.</p>

<p>4. <i>Hours with the Bible.</i> Cunningham Geikie. Six volumes,
discussing Bible history in all of its aspects, particularly
in its relations with secular history. Perhaps this is the best
work on the subject for the reader who is not a specialist.
But it is prolix, and could be compressed to advantage.</p>

<p>There is need, in my opinion, of a good semi-popular Bible
history, in one volume or two, to present results rather than
processes of thought, and to embody all the latest knowledge
from the study of the Scriptures and the monuments of the
ancient world.</p>

<p>It is needless to urge upon the student that the best book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
for the study of Bible history is the Bible itself. The historical
books should be read with great care, even to their details
of genealogical tables. The most valuable document in the
study of the origin of races is the tenth chapter of Genesis;
and a catalogue of names in the opening of Chronicles will
give a clew to the chronology of the sojourn in Egypt. The
prophetical books will aid the student, and the Psalms will
irradiate certain dark periods. Whoever undertakes to use
these outlines should examine every text cited for its suggestion
upon the subject.</p>

<p>This book is commended to Bible students, to Sunday-school
normal classes, and to all who love the word, with a
hope that it may be of service in calling attention to the Old
Testament, and that it may lead some through the Old to
enter into a better spiritual understanding of the New.</p>

<h2>HINTS TO STUDENTS.</h2>


<p>Those who desire merely to <i>read</i> this book or to look it over will not
find it interesting. Those who already know how to study will not need
these hints, and can use the book in their own way. But there are many
who desire to study these subjects carefully, and yet do not know precisely
how to do the work. For these students, earnest but untrained, the hints
are given.</p>

<p>1. These studies should be pursued with the Bible close at hand, so that
every Scripture reference may be at once searched out and read.</p>

<p>2. Begin each lesson by a general view; reading it through carefully,
and memorizing the leading divisions of the outline, which are indicated by
the Roman numerals I, II, III, etc. This will give the general plan of
the lesson.</p>

<p>3. Now take up Part I of the lesson in detail; notice and memorize its
subdivisions, indicated by 1, 2, 3, etc., and search out the Scripture references
cited in it. If practicable, write out on a sheet of paper the reference
(not the language of the text in full), and what each reference shows. Thus,
with the references in the First Study, <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>, Part I:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beginnings of Bible History.</span> Part I. <b>Deluge.</b></p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gen. 7. Description of the flood.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gen. 6. 5-7. God punished the world for wickedness.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Gen. 7. 23. Covered the inhabited earth.</span><br />
</div>

<p>4. It would be a good plan to write out in full, as a connected statement,
all the facts in the section; thus: "The Bible says there was a deluge and
the traditions of other nations attest it. The date commonly given is 2348
B. C. Its cause was God's anger with the wickedness of the race, and it
covered the inhabited globe. God's purpose was to cleanse the world for a
new epoch."</p>

<p>5. In like manner study out and write out all the facts obtained by a
study of the lesson and the texts cited in it. This will greatly aid the
memory in holding fast to the information gained.</p>

<p>6. Having done this, look at the blackboard outline at the end of the
study, and see if you can read the outline of the lesson by the aid of the
catch-words and indications which it affords. Study the lesson until you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
can read it with the blackboard outline, and then recall it without the outline.</p>

<p>7. Now read over the questions for review, one by one, and see if you
can answer them. Do not cease your study until every question can be
answered without the aid of the text.</p>

<p>8. Frequently review the lessons already learned. Before beginning the
third study review the first and the second; before the fourth, review the first,
second, and third, and at the completion of all the studies review them all.
The knowledge gained by this thorough study will more than compensate
for the time and trouble which it requires.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h2>HINTS TO TEACHERS.</h2>


<p>Classes may be organized on various plans and out of varied materials
for the study of these lessons.</p>

<p>1. A teachers' class, composed of teachers, and also of senior scholars in
the Sunday-school, may be formed to study the life of Christ, which is one
of the most important subjects in the Bible. This may meet on an evening
or an afternoon, and devote all the sessions to the study of the lesson, and
to discussions upon it.</p>

<p>2. In many places a teachers' meeting is held for the study of the International
Lesson, as a preparation for the Sunday-school class. A part
of the time might be taken at this meeting for the study of these subjects.
In that case it would be well to follow the division into lessons, as given
on <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>.</p>

<p>3. A normal class may be organized among the brightest scholars in the
Sunday-school, who should be trained to become teachers. This normal
class may meet on an afternoon or an evening, or may take a lesson-period
in the Sunday-school session.</p>

<p>4. These studies may be pursued by the young people's society of the
church, or by a class formed under its auspices, meeting at such time and
place as shall be found most convenient.</p>

<p>There are two methods in which these lessons may be taught: One is
the <i>lecture method</i>, by which the instructor gives the lesson to the class in
the form of a lecture, placing the outline upon the blackboard as he proceeds,
calling upon the students to read the texts cited, and frequently reviewing
the outline in a concert-drill. By this method the students may
or may not have the books, as they and the instructor prefer. While it is
not necessary to supply the class with the text-book, it will be a good plan
to do so.</p>

<p>The other method, simpler and easier, is to let each student have a copy
of the book, to expect the lesson to be prepared by the class, and to have
it recited, either individually or in concert. Let each student gain all the
information that he can upon the subject of the lesson; let each contribute
his knowledge; let all talk freely, and all will be the gainers.</p>

<p>It would be a good plan to have papers read from time to time upon
topics suggested by the course and parallel with it. A list of subjects for
such special papers is given at the close of each study.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE COURSE DIVIDED INTO LESSONS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> many places it will be found impracticable to give an entire evening
to the study of these lessons. They may be taught at the close of the
prayer-meeting, or of the young people's meeting, in short sections; or they
may occupy a part of the hour at the weekly teachers' meeting for the study
of the Sunday-school lesson; or they may be taught to the Normal class in
the Sunday-school at the lesson hour. In the latter case, the regular lesson
should receive some attention; and the members of the class should be expected
to prepare it, and should be questioned upon it.</p>

<p>Often from twenty to thirty minutes is all that can be given in a class to
studies like these. We have, therefore, divided the studies into short sections,
each of which may be taught in about twenty minutes, if properly
prepared by both teacher and students. Thus arranged, the course will
be included in thirty-two lessons, as follows:</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">First Study.</span></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BEGINNINGS OF BIBLE HISTORY.</div>


<p>It is our purpose in this series of studies to trace the
progress of events as related in the Bible from the dawn of
history down to the opening of the New Testament era. The
aim will be not to give a mere catalogue of facts, but rather
to show the relation of cause and effect, and to unfold the
development of the divine purpose which extends through all
the history in the Bible. We recommend the student, first of
all, to read the preface to this book.</p>

<p>Turning back to the beginnings of Bible history we notice
<b>six events</b> between the Deluge and the Exodus. We
begin with the Deluge as the starting-point of history. Back
of that event is a land of shadows. We have so little knowledge
of the world before the flood that its history cannot be
written. But since that fact we tread upon firm ground, having
both the Bible and secular history to confirm each other.</p>

<p>I. <b>THE DELUGE.</b> With regard to this event we note:</p>

<p>1. The <b>fact</b> of a general deluge is stated in Scripture (Gen.
7.), and attested by the traditions of nearly all nations.
Compare the story of Xisuthros in Berosus; the record in the
Chaldean tablets; the Greek myth of Deucalion; the Mexican
tradition; and the legends of the North American Indians.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>2. The <b>date</b> is given in reference Bibles (following Archbishop
Ussher) as B. C. 2348. This is probably incorrect. It
may have been a thousand years earlier. But as arch&aelig;ologists
are not yet agreed, we give Ussher's chronology, here and
elsewhere, merely as a convenience in the arrangement, not
as accurate.</p>

<p>3. Its <b>cause</b> was the wickedness of the human race (Gen.
6. 5-7). Before this event all the population of the world
was massed together, forming one vast family and speaking
one language. Under these conditions the good were overborne
by evil surroundings, and general corruption followed.</p>

<p>4. Its <b>extent</b> was undoubtedly not the entire globe, but so
much of it as was occupied by the human race (Gen. 7. 23),
probably the Euphrates valley. Many Christian scholars,
however, hold to the view that the Book of Genesis relates
the history of but one family of races, and not all the race;
consequently, that the flood may have been partial, as far as
mankind is concerned.</p>

<p>5. Its <b>purpose</b> was: 1.) To destroy the evil in the world.
2.) To open a new epoch under better conditions for social,
national, and individual life.</p>

<p>II. <b>THE DISPERSION OF THE RACES.</b> (B.C.
2247?) 1. Very soon after the deluge a new <b>instinct</b>, that
<b>of migration</b>, took possession of the human family. Hitherto
all mankind had lived together; from this time they began to
scatter. As a result came tribes, nations, languages, and varieties
of civilization. "The confusion of tongues" was not
the cause, but the result of this spirit, and was not sudden,
but gradual (Gen. 11. 2, 7).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
<a href="images/i-025-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-025.jpg" width="500" height="281" alt="MAP OF THE OLD TESTAMENT WORLD." title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>2. <b>Evidences of this migration</b> are given: 1.) In the Bible
(Gen. 9. 19; 11. 8). 2.) The records and traditions of nearly all
nations point to it. 3.) Language gives a certain proof; for
example, showing that the ancestors of the English, Greeks,
Romans, Medes, and Hindus&mdash;races now widely dispersed&mdash;once
slept under the same roof. At an early period streams<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of migration poured forth from the highlands of Asia in every
direction and to great distances.</p>

<p>III. <b>THE RISE OF THE EMPIRES.</b> In the Bible
world three centers of national life arose, not far apart in
time, each of which became a powerful kingdom, and in turn
ruled all the Oriental lands. The strifes of these three nations,
their rise and fall, constitute the matter of ancient
Oriental history, which is closely connected with that of the
Bible. These three centers were Egypt (called in the Bible
Mizraim, Gen. 10. 6, 13), of which the capital was Memphis;
Chaldea, of which the capital was Babel or Babylon (Gen. 10.
10; 11. 2-9); and Assyria, of which the capital was Nineveh
(Gen. 10. 11). We might add to these the Canaanite or
Phenician city of Sidon (Gen. 10. 15, 19), and its daughter
Tyre, the great commercial centers of the ancient world, whose
empire was not the land, but the sea. Note that all of these
early kingdoms were established by the Hamitic race.</p>

<p>IV. <b>THE MIGRATION OF ABRAHAM.</b> (B. C.
1921?) No other journey in history has the <i>importance</i> of
that transfer of the little clan of Abraham from the plain of
Shinar to the mountains of Palestine in view of its results to
the world. Compare with it the voyage of the <i>Mayflower</i>.
Its causes were: 1. Probably the migratory instinct of the
age, for it was the epoch of tribal movements. 2. The political
cause may have been the desire for liberty from the rule
of the Accadian dynasty that had become dominant in Chaldea.
3. But the deepest motive was religious, a purpose to
escape from the idolatrous influences of Chaldea, and to find
a home for the worship of God in what was then "the new
West," where population was thin. It was by the call of God
that Abraham set forth on his journey (Gen. 12. 1-3).</p>

<p>V. <b>THE JOURNEYS OF THE PATRIARCHS.</b>
(B. C. 1921-1706?) For two centuries the little clan of
Abraham's family lived in Palestine as strangers, pitching
their tents in various localities, wherever pasturage was abundant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
for at this time they were shepherds and herdsmen (Gen.
13. 2; 46. 34). Their home was generally in the southern
part of the country, west of the Dead Sea, and their relations
with the Amorites, Canaanites, and Philistines on the soil were
generally friendly (Gen. 20. 14; 26. 26-31).</p>

</div>

<p>VI. <b>THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT.</b> (B. C. 1706-1491?)
After three generations the branch of Abraham's
family belonging to his grandson Jacob or Israel removed to
Egypt (Deut. 26. 5), where they
remained either two hundred or
four hundred years, according to
different opinions.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> This stay in
Egypt is always called "the sojourn."
The event which led directly
to the descent into Egypt was the selling of Joseph
(Gen. 37. 28). But we can trace a providential purpose in
the transfer. Its objects were:</p>

<p>1. <b>Preservation.</b> The frequent famines in Palestine
(Gen. 12. 10; 26. 1;42. 1-3) showed that as shepherds the
Israelites could not be supported in the land. On the fertile
soil of Egypt, with three crops each year, they would find food
in abundance.</p>

<p>2. <b>Growth.</b> At the end of the stay in Canaan the Israelites
counted only seventy souls (Gen. 46. 27); but at the
close of the sojourn in Egypt they had increased to nearly
two millions (Exod. 12. 37; Num. 1. 45, 46). The hot
climate and cheap food of Egypt has always caused an abundant
population. In Egypt Israel grew from a family to a
nation.</p>

<p>3. <b>Isolation.</b> There was great danger to the morals and
religion of the Israelites in the land of Canaan. Abraham
had sent to his own relatives at Haran for a wife for Isaac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
(Gen. 24. 3, 4) in order to keep both the race and the faith
pure. One of Isaac's sons married Canaanite wives, and as
a result his descendants, the Edomites, lost the faith and became
idolaters (Gen. 26. 34, 35). Jacob sought his wives
among his own relatives (Gen. 28. 1, 2). We note a dangerous
tendency in Jacob's family to ally themselves with the
Canaanites (Gen. 34. 8-10; 38. 1, 2). If they had stayed in
Canaan the chosen family would have become lost among the
heathen. But in Egypt they lived apart, and were kept by
the caste system from union with the people (Gen. 46. 34;
43. 32). It was a necessary element in the divine plan that
Israel should dwell apart from other nations (Num. 23. 9).</p>

<p>4. <b>Civilization.</b> The Egyptians were far in advance of
all other nations of that age in intelligence, in the organization
of society, and in government. Though the Israelites
lived apart from them, they were among them, and learned
much of their knowledge. Whatever may have been their
condition at the beginning of the sojourn, at the end of it
they had a written language (Exod. 24. 7), a system of worship
(Exod. 19. 22; 33. 7), and a leader who had received the
highest culture of his age (Acts 7. 22). As one result of the
sojourn the Israelites were transformed from shepherds and
herdsmen to tillers of the soil&mdash;a higher manner of living.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> From the fact that in several genealogies four generations are given to the sojourn in
Egypt, the shorter period, from 1706 to 1491, has been generally assumed. But it is almost
impossible that seventy people could become two million in four generations by natural
increase alone. Moreover, the genealogy of Joshua (1 Chron. 7. 22-27) gives either ten
or eleven generations to this period. It is probable that the other tables name only sufficient
links to show the line, and omit many of the generations. This was frequently
the case with Jewish records. (See the genealogy of Jesus Christ in Matt. 1, where
several names are omitted.) We conclude that the sojourn began about 1900 B. C., and
the call of Abraham was about 2100 B. C., or earlier; but we give in the text the usual

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE WANDERING IN THE WILDERNESS.</div>


<p>I. Let us notice briefly the <b>EVENTS LEADING TO
THE WANDERING.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>The Oppression of the Israelites.</b> (B. C. 1635.)
(Exod. 1. 8-13.) This was an important link in the chain
of events. If the Israelites had been prosperous and happy
in Egypt they would have remained there, and the destiny
of the chosen people would have been forgotten. Therefore,
when Egypt had given to Israel all that it could, the wrath
of man was made to praise God; and by suffering the Israelites
were made willing to leave the land of their sojourn and
seek the land of promise. The nest was stirred up, and the
young eaglet was compelled to fly (Deut. 32. 11, 12).</p>

<p>2. <b>The Training of Moses.</b> (Born B. C. 1571.) There
was another element of preparation. No common man could
have wrought the great work of liberation, of legislation, and
of training which Israel needed. Notice, 1.) Moses was an
<i>Israelite in birth</i>, of the consecrated tribe of Levi (Exod. 2.
1, 2). 2.) But he was <i>educated in the palace</i>, and in the
highest culture, as a prince in Egypt (Exod. 2. 10). If he
had been doomed to a slave's life he could never have accomplished
his mission. 3.) At full age Moses made <i>choice
of his people</i>, because they were the people of God (Heb. 11.
24-26). 4.) Then came the <i>training of forty years</i> in the
desert, giving him knowledge of the land, experience of hardships,
and maturity of thought. 5.) Lastly, there was the <i>call
of God</i> (Exod. 3. 2), with its revelation of God's name and
power, imparting strength for his work.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Ten Plagues.</b> There was a special significance
in these plagues, for each was a blow at some form of idol-worship
among the Egyptians. They were: 1.) The river
turned to blood (Exod. 7. 20, 21). 2.) Frogs (Exod. 8. 6).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
3.) Lice (Exod. 8. 17). 4.) Flies, probably including beetles
and other winged pests (Exod. 8. 24). 5.) Murrain, or pestilence
among domestic animals (Exod. 9. 3, 4). 6.) Boils
(Exod. 9. 10). 7.) Hail (Exod. 9. 23). 8.) Locusts (Exod.
10. 14, 15). 9.) Darkness (Exod. 10. 22, 23). 10.) Death
of the first-born (Exod. 12. 29).</p>

<p>4. <b>The Passover.</b> (Exod. 12. 21-28.) This service
represented three ideas. 1.) It was the spring-tide festival.
2.) It commemorated the sudden departure from Egypt, when
there was not even time to "raise the bread" before leaving
(Exod. 12. 34-39). 3.) It was an impressive prophecy of
Christ, the slain Lamb of God (Exod. 12. 21, 22).</p>

<a href="images/i-032-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-032.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="JOURNEYS OF THE ISRAELITES" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>5. <b>The Exodus.</b> (B. C. 1491.) (Exod. 12. 40, 41.) The
word means "going out." This was the birthday of a nation,
the hour when the Israelites rose from being merely a mass
of men to become a people.</p>

<p>II. <b>THE WILDERNESS OF THE WANDERING.</b>
Let the student note carefully upon a good map the
following locations, and then draw a map containing them:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>1. Draw the coast-lines and note <b>three Seas</b>. 1.) The
"great sea," or <i>Mediterranean</i> (Josh. 1. 4). 2.) The <i>Red Sea</i>
(Exod. 13. 18), (Gulfs of Suez and Akaba). 3.) The <i>Dead Sea</i>.</p>

<p>2. Draw the mountain ranges, and note <b>five Deserts</b>.
1.) The <i>Desert of Shur</i> (Exod. 15. 22), between Goshen and
Canaan. 2.) The <i>Desert of Paran</i>, in the center of the Sinaitic
triangle (Num. 10. 12). This is the wilderness in which
thirty-eight of the forty years were passed (Deut. 1. 19). 3.)
The <i>Desert of E'ham</i> (Num. 33. 8), on the shore of the Gulf of
Suez. 4.) The <i>Desert of Sin</i>, near Mount Sinai (Exod. 16. 1).
5.) The <i>Desert of Zin</i>, the desolate valley between the Gulf of
Akaba and the Dead Sea, now called the Arabah (Num. 13. 21).</p>

<p>3. Locate also the <b>five Lands</b> of this region. 1.) <i>Goshen</i>,
the land of the sojourn (Exod. 9. 26). 2.) <i>Midian</i>, the land
of Moses's shepherd life (Exod. 2. 15), on both sides of the
Gulf of Akaba. 3.) <i>Edom</i>, the land of Esau's descendants,
south of the Dead Sea (Num. 21. 4). 4.) <i>Moab</i>, the land of
Lot's descendants, east of the Dead Sea (Num. 21. 13).
5.) <i>Canaan</i>, the land of promise (Gen. 12. 7).</p>

<p>4. Fix also the location of <b>three Mountains</b>. 1.) <i>Mount
Sinai</i>, where the law was given (Exod. 19. 20). 2.) <i>Mount
Hor</i>, where Aaron died (Num. 20. 23-28). 3.) <i>Mount Nebo</i>
(Pisgah), where Moses died (Deut. 34. 1).</p>

<p>5. Notice also <b>seven Places</b>, some of which are clearly,
others not so definitely, identified. 1.) <i>Rameses</i>, the starting-point
of the Israelites (Exod. 12. 37). 2.) <i>Baal-zephon</i>, the
place of crossing the Red Sea (Exod. 14. 2). 3.) <i>Marah</i>, where
the bitter waters were sweetened (Exod. 15. 22-25). 4.) <i>Elim</i>,
the place of rest (Exod. 15. 27). 5.) <i>Rephidim</i>, the place of
the first battle, near Mount Sinai (Exod. 17. 8-16). 6.) <i>Kadesh-barnea</i>,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
whence the spies were sent forth (Num. 13. 26).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
7.) <i>Jahaz</i>, in the land of Moab, south of the brook Arnon,
the place of a victory over the Amorites (Num. 21. 23, 24).</p>

<p>III. <b>THE JOURNEYS OF THE WANDERING.</b>
These, with the <b>EVENTS</b> connected with them,
may be arranged in order as follows:</p>

<p>1. From Rameses to the Red Sea (Exod. 12. 37; 14. 9).
With this note: 1.)
<i>The crossing of the
Red Sea.</i></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 274px;">
<a href="images/i-034-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-034.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="VICINITY OF MT. SINAI" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>2. From the Red
Sea to Mount Sinai.
Events: 2.) <i>The
Waters of Marah.</i>
3.) <i>The repulse of the
Amalekites.</i> 4.) <i>The
giving of the law.</i> 5.)
<i>The worship of the
golden calf.</i> At
Mount Sinai the
camp was kept for
nearly a year, and
the organization of
the people was effected.</p>

<p>3. From Mount
Sinai to Kadesh-barnea
(B. C. 1490). At
the latter place occurred,
6.) <i>The sending out of the spies</i> (Num. 13. 1-26). 7.) <i>The
defeat at Hormah</i> (Num. 14. 40-45). It was the purpose of
Moses to lead the people at once from Kadesh up to Canaan.
But their fear of the Canaanite and Amorite inhabitants made
them weak; they were defeated and driven back into the
desert of Paran, where they wandered thirty-eight years, until
the generation of slavish souls should die off, and a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Israel, the young people, trained in the spirit of Moses and
Aaron, and fitted for conquest, should arise in their places.</p>

<p>4. From Kadesh-barnea through the desert of Paran and
return. This was the long wandering of thirty-eight years.
We trace the route from Kadesh, around the desert of Paran,
to Mount Hor, to Ezion-geber at the head of the Gulf of
Akaba, and at last to Kadesh once more (Num. 20. 1). There
occurred, 8.) <i>The water from the rock at Kadesh</i>, and Moses's
disobedience (Num. 20. 10-12). 9.) <i>The repulse of Arad</i>
(Num. 21. 1). It would seem that the Israelites made a
second attempt to enter Canaan on the south, and were again
defeated, though not so severely as before.</p>

<p>5. From Kadesh-barnea around Edom to the river Jordan.
After this second defeat Moses desired to lead the people
through the land of the Edomites, and to enter Canaan by
crossing the Jordan (Num. 20. 14). But the Edomites refused
to permit such an army to pass through their land
(Num. 20. 18-21). Hence the Israelites were compelled to go
down the desert of Zin, past Edom, as far as the Red Sea, then
east of Edom, a very long and toilsome journey (Num. 21. 4).
Note with this journey: 10.) <i>The brazen serpent</i> (Num. 21. 6-9;
John 3. 14, 15). 11.) <i>The victory over the Amorites</i> (Num. 21.
23, 24). This victory gave to the Israelites control of the
country from Amon to Jabbok, and was the first campaign
of the conquest. The long journey was now ended in the encampment
of the Israelites at the foot of Mount Nebo, on the
eastern bank of the Jordan, near the head of the Dead Sea.
12.) The last event of the period was <i>the death of Moses</i>
(Deut. 34. 5-8) (B. C. 1451).</p>

<p>IV. <b>THE RESULTS OF THE WANDERING.</b>
These forty years of wilderness life made a deep impress
upon the Israelite people, and wrought great changes in their
character.</p>

<p>1. It gave them certain <b>Institutions</b>. From the wilderness
they brought their tabernacle and all its rites and services,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
out of which grew the magnificent ritual of the temple.
The Feast of Passover commemorated the Exodus, the Feast
of Pentecost, the giving of the law; the Feast of Tabernacles
(during which for a week the people lived in huts and booths),
the outdoor life in the desert.</p>

<p>2. Another result was <b>National Unity</b>. When the Israelites
left Egypt they were twelve unorganized tribes, without
a distinct national life. Forty years in the wilderness, meeting
adversities together, fighting enemies, marching as one
host, made them a nation. They emerged from the wilderness
a distinct people, with one hope and aim, with patriotic
self-respect, ready to take their place among the nations of
the earth.</p>

<p>3. <b>Individual Liberty.</b> They had just been set free from
the tyranny of the most complete governmental machine on
the face of the earth. In Egypt the man was nothing, the
state was every thing. The Israelite system was an absolute
contrast to the Egyptian. For four centuries after the Exodus
the Israelites lived with almost no government, each
man doing what was right in his own eyes. They were the
freest people on earth, far more so than the Greeks or the
Romans during their republican epochs. Moses trained them
not to look to the government for their care, but to be a self-reliant
people, able to take care of themselves. If they had
passed this initial stage of their history surrounded by kingdoms
they would have become a kingdom. But they learned
their first lessons of national life in the wilderness, untrammeled
by environment and under a wise leader, who sought
to train up a nation of kings instead of a kingdom.</p>

<p>4. <b>Military Training.</b> We trace in the history of those
forty years a great advance in military discipline. After
crossing the Red Sea Moses did not care to lead them by the
direct route to Canaan, lest they should "see war" (Exod.
13. 17, 18). Attacked by the Amalekites soon after the Exodus,
the Israelites were almost helpless (Exod. 17. 8-16;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Deut. 25. 17-19). A year later they were the easy prey of
the Canaanites at Hormah (Num. 14. 40-45). Forty years
after they crossed the Jordan and entered Canaan, a drilled
and trained host, a conquering army. This discipline and
spirit of conquest they gained under Moses and Joshua in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>5. <b>Religious Education.</b> This was the greatest of all
the benefits gained in the wilderness. They were brought
back from the idolatries of Egypt to the faith of their fathers.
They received God's law, the system of worship, and the ritual
which brought them by its services into a knowledge of
God. Moreover, their experience of God's care taught them
to trust in Jehovah, who had chosen them for his own people.
Even though the mass of the people might worship idols,
there was always from this time an Israel of the heart that
sought and obeyed God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Third Study.</span></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CONQUEST OF CANAAN.</div>


<p>I. Let us notice the <b>CANAANITES</b> before the conquest.</p>

<p>1. They were a <b>varied people</b>. There were from seven
to ten different nations in Palestine when the Israelites entered
it (Exod. 3. 17; Deut. 7. 1). Each tribe, often each
city, had its own government. There was no unity of government,
no combined action to resist the invasion of Israel.
This made the conquest easy. If one king had ruled a united
people the result might have been different.</p>

<p>2. These peoples were, however, of <b>one stock</b>. They
belonged to the Hamite race, and were all descended from
the family of Canaan (Gen. 10. 15-19). There was no reason,
except the tribal spirit, for their separation into small
clans and nationalities.</p>

<p>3. They were <b>idolatrous</b> and, as a result, grossly <b>immoral</b>.
Idolatry is always associated with immorality; for the worship
of idols is a deification of sensuality. Baal and Asherah
(plural Ashtoreth) were the male and female divinities worshiped
by most of these races (Judg. 2. 13).</p>

<p>4. They had been <b>weakened</b> before the coming of the
Israelites either by war or by pestilence. The allusions in
Exod. 23. 28; Deut. 7. 20; and Josh. 7. 12, have been referred
to an invasion before that of Israel, or to some plague, which
destroyed the native races.</p>

<p>II. <b>THE CAMPAIGNS OF THE CONQUEST.</b>
These may be divided as follows:</p>

<p>1. <b>The campaigns east of the Jordan.</b> (B. C. 1451.)
These were during the life-time of Moses, and gained for
Israel all the territory between the brook Arnon and Mount
Hermon.</p>

<p>1.) The conquest of Gilead was made at the battle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Jahaz, near the brook Arnon (Num. 21. 21-31). In one
battle the Israelites gained the land of Gilead from the
Arnon to the Hieromax.</p>

<p>2.) The conquest of Bashan was completed at the battle of
Edrei, in the mountainous region.</p>

<p>3.) The conquest
of Midian (Num. 31.
1-8) was led by the
warrior-priest Phinehas,
and by smiting
the tribes on the east
protected the frontier
toward the desert.
The land won
by these three campaigns
became the
territory of the tribes
of Reuben, Gad, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh
(Deut. 32).</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 223px;">
<a href="images/i-041-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-041.jpg" width="223" height="400" alt="JOURNEYS OF THE CONQUEST" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>2. <b>The campaigns
west of
the Jordan</b> (B. C.
1451) were led by
Joshua, and showed
great tactical skill
and resistless energy
of action. Joshua
led his people across
the Jordan and established
a fortified camp, the center of operations during
all his campaigns, at Gilgal (Josh. 4. 19).</p>

<p>1.) The first invasion was of <i>central Palestine</i>, beginning
with Jericho (Josh. 6), taking Ai on the way (Josh. 8), and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
ending with Shechem, which apparently fell without resistance
(Josh. 8. 30-33). This campaign gave to Israel the
center of the land and divided their enemies into two sections.</p>

<p>2.) Next came the campaign against <i>southern Palestine</i>.
At this time was fought the battle of Beth-horon (Josh. 10. 10),
the most momentous in its results in all history, and one over
which, if ever, the sun and moon might well stand still (Josh.
10. 12, 13).<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> After this great victory Joshua pursued his
enemies and took the towns as far south as Hebron and Debir
(Josh. 10. 29-39).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a href="images/i-042-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-042.jpg" width="450" height="281" alt="JOSHUA&#39;S VICTORY AT BETH-HORON." title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>3.) Lastly, Joshua conquered <i>northern Palestine</i> (Josh.
11). The battle in this campaign was near Lake Merom
(Josh. 11. 7), and, as before, it was followed by the capture
of many cities in the north. Thus, in those marches Joshua
won all the mountain region of western Palestine.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>3. There were certain <b>supplementary campaigns</b>, partly
in Joshua's time, partly afterward.</p>

<p>1.) Caleb's rapture of Hebron, which had been re-occupied
by the Amorites (Josh. 14; Judg. 1. 10-15).</p>

<p>2.) The Judahites' capture of Bezek, an unknown place
between Jerusalem and the Philistine plain (Judg. 1. 1-8).</p>

<p>3.) The Danites' capture of Laish, in the extreme north,
which afterward bore the name of Dan (Judg. 18).</p>

<p>But, after all these campaigns, a large part of the land was
still unsubdued, and the war of the conquest did not end until
the days of David, by whom every foe was finally placed
under foot.</p>

<p>III. <b>GENERAL ASPECTS OF ISRAEL AT
THE CLOSE OF THE CONQUEST.</b></p>

<p>1. With regard to <b>the native races</b>. They were not destroyed
nor driven away, as had been commanded.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> They
remained as subject people in some places, as the ruling race
on the sea-coast and in the Jordan valley. We see their influence,
always injurious, throughout all Israel's history (Exod.
23. 31-33; Deut. 7. 1-5); and some think that the present
inhabitants of the country belong to the original Canaanite
stock.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Israelites</b> did not occupy all the country. They
possessed most of the mountain region, but none of the sea-coast
plain on the Jordan valley. They were like the Swiss
in modern times, living among the mountains. Even in the
New Testament period the lowlands were occupied mainly
by Gentiles.</p>

<p>3. <b>The landed system</b> was peculiar. Estates were inalienable.
They might be leased, but not sold; and on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
year of Jubilee (every fiftieth year) all land reverted to the
family originally owning it. Thus every family had its ancestral
home, the poor were protected, and riches were kept
within bounds.</p>

<p>4. <b>The government</b> was a republic of families without
an executive head, except when a judge was raised up to
meet special needs. Each tribe had its own rulers, but there
was no central authority after Joshua (Judg. 21. 25). This
had its evils, for it led to national weakness; but it had its
benefits: 1.) It kept Israel from becoming a great worldly
kingdom like Egypt and Assyria, which would have thwarted
the divine purpose. 2.) It promoted individuality and personal
energy of character. There would have been no "age
of heroes" if Israel had been a kingdom like Egypt.</p>

<p>5. The <b>religious system</b> was simple. There was but
one altar at Shiloh for all the land and for all the tribes, and
the people were required to visit it for the three great feasts
(Deut. 12. 11, 14; Josh. 18. 1). This was the religious bond
which united the people. If it had been maintained they
would have needed no other constitution, and even its partial
observance kept the people one nation.</p>

<p>6. The <b>character</b> of the people was diverse. Throughout
the history we trace the working of two distinct elements.
There was the true Israel&mdash;the earnest, religious, God-worshiping
section, the Israel of Joshua and Gideon and Samuel.
Then there was the underlying mass of the people&mdash;secular,
ignorant, prone to idolatry, the Israel that worshiped Baal and
Ashtoreth, and sought alliance with the heathen. One element
was the hope of the nation, the other was its bane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE AGE OF THE HEROES.</div>


<p>From the death of Joshua (about B. C. 1426) to the coronation
of Saul (B. C. 1095) the twelve tribes of Israel were
without a central government, except as from time to time
men of ability rose up among them. It was not as some have
supposed, "an age of anarchy," for anarchy is confusion; and
during most of the three hundred and thirty years there were
peace and order in Israel. It was rather an age of heroes,
for its rulers were neither hereditary nor elective, but men
called forth by the needs of the hour and their own qualities
of leadership.</p>

<p>I. <b>THE CONDITION OF ISRAEL DURING
THIS PERIOD.</b> This was partly favorable, and partly
unfavorable. The favorable elements were:</p>

<p>1. <b>The mountain location</b> of Israel. The tribes were
perched like Switzerland in the Alps. There was a desert on
the south and on the east, while on the west lay the plain by
the sea, the great route of travel between Egypt and the Euphrates.
Great armies passed and repassed over this plain,
and great battles were fought by Egyptians, Hittites, and Assyrians,
while Israel on her mountain peaks was unmolested.
This mountain home left Israel generally unnoticed, and,
when attacked, almost inaccessible.</p>

<p>2. <b>The racial unity</b> of Israel. The two finest races of
the world, the Greek and the Israelite, were both of pure
blood. The Israelites were one in origin, in language, in
traditions, in aspirations. This national unity often brought
the tribes together in times of distress; though not always
when their union was needed.</p>

<p>3. <b>The religious institutions.</b> In Greece every town
had its own god and its own religion; hence the many parties
and petty nationalities. But in Israel there was in theory but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
one altar, one house of God, one system of worship, with its
annual pilgrimage to the religious capital (1 Sam. 1. 3). Just
to the measure in which these institutions were observed,
Israel was strong against all foes, and as they were neglected
the land became the prey of oppressors (Judg. 2. 7-14; 1.
Sam. 7. 3).</p>

<p>But there were also unfavorable elements in the condition
of Israel, which threatened its very existence. These were:</p>

<p>1. <b>The native races.</b> These were of two kinds: the
subject peoples left on the soil, more or less under the domination
of the conquerors, and the surrounding nations, Ammon,
Moab, Syria, and the Philistines. There was danger
from their enmity, a rebellion of the subject tribes, allied with
the enemies around, for the destruction of Israel. And there
was far greater danger from their friendship, which would
lead to intermarriage, to idolatry, to corruption of morals, and
to ruin (Judg. 3. 1-7).</p>

<p>2. <b>Lack of a central government.</b> Israel was in
the condition of the United States at the close of the Revolution,
from 1783 to 1789, a loose confederation with no
central authority. There were twelve tribes, but each governed
itself. Only under some great chieftain like Gideon or
Samuel were all the twelve tribes united. Most of the judges
ruled only over their own district of a few adjoining tribes.
Often the northern tribes were in peril, but we never read of
Judah going to their assistance; and in Judah's wars with
the Philistines the northern tribes stood aloof.</p>

<p>3. <b>Tribal jealousy.</b> Until the establishment of the
American republic the world never saw, for any length of
time, a league of states on an equal footing. In Greece the
strongest state claimed the <i>hegemony</i>, or leadership, and oppressed
its allies. In Italy the Romans reduced all their
neighbors to subjection. In Europe it now requires an army
of more than a million men to maintain the "balance of
power." So in Israel there was a constant struggle for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
leadership between the two great tribes of Judah and Ephraim.
During the period of the judges Ephraim was constantly asserting
its right to rule the other tribes (Judg. 8. 1-3; 12.
1-6). We trace this rivalry through all the reign of David;
and at last it led to the division of the empire under Rehoboam.</p>

<p>4. <b>Idolatrous tendencies.</b> We note constantly "the
two Israels"&mdash;a spiritual minority and an irreligious, idolatrous
mass. For ten centuries the greatest evil of Israelite
history was the tendency to the worship of idols. Causes
which operated to promote it were: 1.) The natural craving
for a visible object of worship, not altogether eradicated from
even the Christian heart; for example, Romish images and
ritualistic bowing toward the altar. 2.) The association of
Israel with idolaters on the soil or as neighbors. 3.) The opportunity
which idol-worship gives to gratify lust under the
guise of religion. As a result of these forces we find idol-worship
the crying sin of the Israelites down to the captivity
in Babylon.</p>

<p>II. <b>THE JUDGES OF ISRAEL.</b> These were the
heroes of that age, the men who in turn led the tribes, freed
them from their enemies, and restored them to the service of
God.</p>

<p>1. <b>Their office.</b> It was not generally to try legal cases
between man and man, or between tribe and tribe. It might
be regarded as a military dictatorship blended with a religious
authority. The judge was a union of the warrior and the religious
reformer.</p>

<p>2. <b>Their appointment</b>; not by election, nor the votes of
the people. The Orientals have never chosen their rulers by
suffrage. The judges were men whom the people recognized
as called of God to their office (Judg. 2. 16; 3. 9; 6. 11-13).</p>

<p>3. <b>Their authority</b> rested not on law, nor on armies, but
on the personal elements of integrity and leadership in the
men, and on the general belief in their inspiration. They
spoke to the people with the authority of a messenger from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
God. They arose in some hour of great need, and after the
immediate danger was over held their power until the end of
their lives.</p>

<p>4. <b>The extent of their rule</b> was generally local, over a
few tribes in one section. Deborah ruled in the north (Judg.
5. 14-18); Jephthah governed the east of the Jordan only
(Judg. 11. 29). Often more than one judge was ruling at the
same time; probably Samson and Eli were contemporaneous.
Gideon and Samuel alone ruled all the twelve tribes.</p>

<p>III. <b>THE OPPRESSIONS AND DELIVERERS.</b>
During these three centuries the influences already named
brought Israel many times under the domination of foreign
power. The story was always the same, forsaking God, following
idols, subjection, reformation, victory, and temporary prosperity.
We notice the seven oppressions. Some of these
were undoubtedly contemporaneous.</p>

<p>1. <b>The Mesopotamian Oppression.</b> (Judg. 3. 7-11.)
Probably this was over the southern portion, and the invaders
came by the east and around the Dead Sea, as earlier invaders
from the same land had come (Gen. 14. 1-7). The deliverer
was Othniel, the first judge, and the only judge of the
tribe of Judah.</p>

<p>2. <b>The Moabite Oppression.</b> (Judg. 3. 12-30.) Over
the eastern and central section, including Ephraim (verse 27);
deliverer, Ehud, the second judge; battle fought at the ford
of the river Jordan (verse 28).</p>

<p>3. <b>The Early Philistine Oppression.</b> (Judg. 3. 31.)
Over the south-west, on the frontier of Judah; deliverer,
Shamgar.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Canaanite Oppression.</b> (Judg. 4.) Over the
northern tribes; deliverer, Deborah, the woman judge; battle
at Mount Tabor.</p>

<p>5. <b>The Midianite Oppression.</b> (Judg. 6. 1-6.) Over
the northern center, especially Manasseh-east; the most
severe of all; deliverer, Gideon, the greatest of the judges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
(Judg. 6. 11, 12); battle, on Mount Gilboa (Judg. 7), followed
by other victories (Judg. 8).</p>

<p>6. <b>The Ammonite Oppression.</b> (Judg. 10. 7-9.) Note
an alliance between the Amorites and Philistines, which is
suggestive; mainly over the tribes on the east of Jordan;
deliverer, Jephthah<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> (Judg. 11); victory at Aroer (verse 33).</p>

<p>7. <b>The Philistine Oppression.</b> (Judg. 13) This was
the most protracted of all, for it extended, with intervals of
freedom, for a hundred years; embraced all the land, but
was most heavily felt south of Mounts Carmel and Gilboa.
The liberation was begun by Samson (Judg. 13. 5), but he
was led astray by sensual lusts and became a failure. Freedom
was later won by Samuel at the battle of Ebenezer
(1 Sam. 7. 7-14); but the oppression was renewed in the time
of Saul, and became heavier than ever (1 Sam. 13. 17-20).
Finally the yoke was broken by David, in a succession of
victories, ending with the capture of Gath, the Philistine capital
(2 Sam. 5. 17-25; 1 Chron. 18. 1).</p>

<p>Note with each oppression: 1.) The oppressor. 2.) The
section oppressed. 3.) The deliverer. 4.) The battlefield.</p>

<p>IV. <b>THE GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE
PERIOD.</b></p>

<p>1. It was an age of <b>individuality</b>. There was no strong
government to oppress the people, to concentrate all the life
of the nation at the court, and to repress individuality. Contrast
Persia with Greece; Rome under the emperors with Rome
as a republic. As men were needed they were raised up, for
there was opportunity for character. Hence it was an age of
heroes&mdash;Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson,
Samuel, etc. Free institutions bring strong men to the front.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>2. It was an age of <b>neglect of the law</b>. During all this
period there is no allusion to the law of Moses. Its regulations
were ignored, except so far as they belonged to the common
law of conscience and right. The laws of Moses were
not deliberately disobeyed, but were ignorantly neglected.
Even good men, as Gideon and Samuel, built altars and
offered sacrifices (Judg. 6. 24; 1 Sam. 7. 9) contrary to the
letter of the law of Moses, but obeying its spirit.</p>

<p>3. Nevertheless, it was an age of <b>progress</b>. There were
alternate advancements and retrogressions; yet we see a people
with energy, rising in spite of their hindrances. By degrees
government became more settled (1 Sam. 7. 15-17),
foreign relations arose (1 Sam. 7. 14; Ruth 1. 1), and the people
began to look toward a more stable system (1 Sam. 8. 4-6).</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Fifth Study.</span></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RISE OF THE ISRAELITE EMPIRE.</div>


<p>The coronation of Saul (B. C. 1095) marks an epoch in
the history of Israel. From that point, for five hundred years,
the chosen people were under the rule of kings.</p>

<p>I. <b>THE CAUSES LEADING TO THE MONARCHY.</b>
The kingdom was not an accidental nor a sudden
event. There had been a gradual preparation for it through
all the period of the judges.</p>

<p>1. Note the <b>tendency toward settled government</b>. In
the time of Gideon the people desired him to become a king
(Judg. 8. 22, 23). His son attempted to make himself a
king, but failed (Judg. 9). We find judges setting up a semi-royal
state, and making marriages for their children outside of
their tribe (Judg. 12. 9, 13, 14). Judges associating their sons
with themselves (Judg. 10. 4; 1 Sam. 8. 1, 2). All these show
a monarchical trend in the time.</p>

<p>2. Another cause was the <b>consolidation of the surrounding
nations</b>. In the days of the conquest there were
few kings in the lands neighboring Palestine. We read of
"lords" and "elders," but no kings, among the Philistines,
the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the Phenicians (Judg. 3.
3; 1 Sam. 5. 8; Num. 22. 7). But a wave of revolution
swept over all those lands, as about the same time over
Greece; and very soon we find that every nation around Israel
had its king (1 Sam. 21. 10; 11. 1; 22. 3; 2 Sam. 5. 11).
The movement of Israel toward monarchy was in accordance
with this spirit.</p>

<p>3. There was a <b>danger of invasion</b>, which impelled the
Israelites to seek for a stronger government (1 Sam. 12. 12).
They felt themselves weak, while other nations were organized
for conquest, and desired a king for leader in war.</p>

<p>4. Then, too, the <b>rule of Samuel</b> led the Israelites to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
desire a better organization of the government. For twenty
years they had enjoyed the benefit of a wise, strong, and
steady rule. They felt unwilling to risk the dangers of tribal
dissension after the death of Samuel, and therefore they sought
for a king.</p>

<p>5. But underlying all was the <b>worldly ambition</b> of the
people. They were not willing to remain the people of God,
and work out a peculiar destiny. They wished to be like the
nations around, to establish a secular state, to conquer an
empire for themselves (1 Sam. 8. 5-20). It was this worldly
spirit, whose results Samuel saw, which made him unwilling
to accede to the wish of the Israelites. But the very things
against which he warned them (1 Sam. 8. 11-18) were just
what they desired.</p>

<p>II. <b>THE CHARACTER OF THE ISRAELITE
KINGDOM.</b> When men change their plans God changes
his. He desired Israel to remain a republic, and not to enter
into worldly relations and aims. When, however, the Israelites
were determined, God gave them a king (1 Sam. 8. 22);
but his rule was not to be like that of the nations around Israel.
We ascertain the divine ideal of a kingdom for his
chosen people:</p>

<p>1. <b>It was a theocratic kingdom.</b> That is, it recognized
God as the supreme ruler, and the king as his representative,
to rule in accordance with his will, and not by his
own right. Only as people and king conformed to this principle
could the true aims of the kingdom be accomplished
(1 Sam. 12. 13-15). And if the king should deviate from this
order, he should lose his throne. Disobedience to the divine
will caused the kingdom to pass from the family of Saul to
that of David (1 Sam. 13. 13, 14; 15. 26).</p>

<p>2. <b>It was a constitutional kingdom.</b> The rights of
the people were carefully guaranteed, and there was a written
constitution (1 Sam. 10. 25). Nearly all the Oriental countries
have always been governed by absolute monarchs; but Israel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was an exception to this rule. The people could demand
their rights from Rehoboam (1 Kings 12. 3, 4). Ahab could
not take away nor even buy Naboth's vineyard against its
owner's will (1 Kings 21. 1-3). No doubt the rights of the
people were often violated; but the violation was contrary to
the spirit of the monarchy.</p>

<p>3. <b>It was regulated by the prophets.</b> The order of
prophets had a regular standing in the Israelite state. The
prophet was a check upon the power of the king, as a representative
both of God's will and the people's rights. He
spoke not only of his own opinions, but by the authority of
God. Notice instances of the boldness of prophets in rebuking
kings (1 Sam. 15. 16-23; 2 Sam. 12. 1-7; 1 Kings
13. 1-6; 17. 1; 22. 7-17). The order of prophets was
like the House of Commons, between the king and the
people.</p>

<p>III. <b>THE REIGN OF SAUL.</b> (B. C. 1095-1055.)
1. This may be divided into two parts: 1.) <i>a period of prosperity</i>,
during which Saul ruled well, and freed Israel from its
oppressors on every side (1 Sam. 14. 47, 48); 2.) then a <i>period
of decline</i>, in which Saul's kingdom seems to be falling in
pieces, and only preserved by the prowess and ability of
David. After David's exile the Philistines again overran Israel,
and Saul's reign ended in defeat and death.</p>

<p>2. We observe that Saul's reign was <b>a failure</b>, and left
the tribes in worse condition than it found them. 1.) He
failed <i>in uniting the tribes</i>; for tribal jealousies continued
(1 Sam. 10. 27), and at the close of his reign broke out anew
in the establishment of rival thrones (2 Sam. 2. 4, 8, 9). 2.)
He failed <i>in making friends</i>. He alienated Samuel, and with
him the order of prophets (1 Sam. 15. 35); he alienated David,
the ablest young man of his age, and the rising hope of
Israel, and drove him into exile (1 Sam. 21. 10); he alienated
the entire order of the priests, and caused many of them
to be massacred (1 Sam. 22. 18). 3.) He failed <i>to advance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
religion</i>; left the tabernacle in ruins; left the ark in seclusion;
broke up the service; and drove the priests whom he
did not murder into exile (1 Sam. 22. 20-23). 4.) He failed
<i>to liberate Israel</i>; at his death the yoke of the Philistines was
more severe than ever before (1 Sam. 31. 1-7). The most
charitable view of Saul was that he was insane during the
latter years of his life. The cause of his failure was a desire
to reign as an absolute monarch, and an unwillingness to submit
to the constitution of the realm.</p>

<p>IV. <b>THE REIGN OF DAVID.</b> (B. C. 1055-1015.)
This was a brilliant period; for it was led by a great man, in
nearly every respect the greatest after Moses in Israelite
history.</p>

<p>1. Notice the <b>condition of Israel at his accession</b>.
This will throw into relief the greatness of his character and
his achievements.</p>

<p>1.) It was a <i>subject people</i>; under Philistine yoke; its warriors
slain; many of its cities deserted; David himself probably
at first tributary to the King of Gath.</p>

<p>2.) It was a <i>disorganized people</i>. The tribes were divided;
national unity was lost; and two thrones were set up, one at
Hebron, the other at Mahanaim (2 Sam. 2. 4-9).</p>

<p>3.) It was a <i>people without religion</i>. The tabernacle was
gone; the ark was in neglect; there was no altar and no sacrifice;
the priests had been slain.</p>

<p>We can scarcely imagine Israel at a lower ebb than when
David was called to the throne.</p>

<p>2. We ascertain <b>David's achievements</b>; the results of
his reign. 1.) <i>He united the tribes.</i> At first crowned king by
Judah only, later he was made king over all the tribes, by
the desire of all (2 Sam. 5. 1-5). During his reign we find
but little trace of the old feud between Ephraim and Judah,
though it was not dead, and destined yet to rend the kingdom
asunder.</p>

<p>2.) <i>He subjugated the land.</i> The conquest of Palestine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
left incomplete by Joshua, and delayed for three hundred
years, was finished at last by David in the capture of
Jebus or Jerusalem (2 Sam. 5. 6, 7), in the overthrow of
the Philistines (2 Sam. 5. 17-25), and in the final capture of
their capital city (1
Chron. 18. 1). At
last Israel was possessor
of its own
land.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 227px;">
<a href="images/i-059-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-059.jpg" width="227" height="400" alt="EMPIRE OF DAVID" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>3.) <i>He organized
the government.</i> He
established a capital
(2 Sam. 5. 9). He
built a palace (2
Sam. 5. 11). Notice
that the builders
were from Tyre,
showing that the Israelites
were not advanced
in the arts.
He established a system
of government,
with officers in the
court and throughout
the realm (1
Chron. 27. 25-34).
Contrast all this with
Saul, who ruled from
his tent, like a Bedouin
sheik.</p>

<p>4.) <i>He established
an army.</i> There was a royal body-guard, probably of foreigners,
like that of many European kings in modern times (2 Sam.
8. 18; 15. 18). There was a band of heroes, like Arthur's
Round Table (2 Sam. 23. 8-39). There was "the host," the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
available military force, divided into twelve divisions, one on
duty each month (1 Chron. 27. 1-15).</p>

<p>5.) <i>He established religion.</i> No sooner was David on the
throne than he brought the ark out of its hiding-place, and
gave it a new home in his capital (1 Chron. 16. 1). The
priesthood was organized, and divided into courses for the
service of the tabernacle (1 Chron. 23. 27-32; 24. 1-19).
He wrote many psalms, and caused others to be written, for
the worship of God. Two prophets stood by his throne
(1 Chron. 29. 29), and two high-priests stood by the altar
(1 Chron. 24. 3). This organization and uplifting of the public
worship had a great effect upon the kingdom.</p>

<p>6.) <i>He conquered all the surrounding nations.</i> These wars
were largely forced upon David by the jealousy of the neighboring
kingdoms. In turn his armies conquered and annexed
to his dominions the land of the Philistines (1 Chron. 18. 1),
Moab (2 Sam. 8. 2), Syria, even to the great river Euphrates
(2 Sam. 8. 3-6); Edom (2 Sam. 8. 14), Ammon, and the country
east of Palestine (2 Sam. 10. 1-14; 12. 26-31). The
empire of David thus extended from the frontier of Egypt to
the Euphrates River, fulfilling the promise of Josh 1. 4. It
was at least six times the area of the twelve tribes.</p>

<p>7.) We may add that <i>he reigned as a theocratic king</i>. He
realized more than any other monarch the divine ideal of a
ruler, and so was "the man after God's own heart" (1 Sam.
13. 14); if not altogether in personal character, yet in the
principles of his government. He respected the rights of his
subjects, had a sympathy for all people, obeyed the voice of
the prophets, and sought the interests of God's cause.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE GOLDEN AGE OF ISRAEL.</div>


<p>The reign of Solomon (B. C. 1015-975) may be regarded
as the culminating period in the history of Israel. But,
strictly speaking, the latter part of David's reign and only the
former part of Solomon's constitute "the golden age of
Israel;" for Solomon's later years manifested a decline, which
after his death rapidly grew to a fall.</p>

<p>I. <b>THE REIGN OF SOLOMON.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>His claim to the throne.</b> He was one of the youngest
of David's sons, the second child of Bath-sheba, born during
the culmination of David's reign (1 Chron. 22. 7-9). He
obtained the throne by the decree of David, by the choice of
God, as the one among David's children best fitted to reign
(1 Chron. 28. 5, 6). The principle of primogeniture, or the
special right of the eldest son, was not fixed in those times.</p>

<p>2. <b>His accession</b> was marked by the execution of three
men, Adonijah (1 Kings 2. 24, 25), Joab (1 Kings 2. 28-34),
and Shimei (1 Kings 2. 36-46). Two of these had conspired
against him, and the third was the last survivor of the house
of Saul, and a possible rival for the throne. Their death was
dictated by policy, and probably by justice. His throne
would not be secure while these men lived.</p>

<p>3. <b>His empire</b> embraced all the lands from the Red Sea
to the Euphrates, and from the Mediterranean to the Syrian
desert, except Phenicia, which was isolated by the Lebanon
Mountains. 1.) Besides Palestine he ruled over Edom,
Moab, Ammon, Syria (here referring to the district having
Damascus as its capital), Zobah, and Hamath. 2.) On the
Gulf of Akaba, Ezion-geber was his southern port (1 Kings
9. 26); on the Mediterranean, Gaza (Azzah) was his limit;
in the extreme north, Tiphsah, by the Euphrates (1 Kings 4.
24); in the desert, Tadmor, afterward Palmyra (1 Kings 9. 18).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>His foreign relations</b> were extensive, for the first and
only time in the history of Israel. 1.) His earliest treaty was
<i>with Tyre</i> (Phenicia), whose king had been his father's friend
(1 Kings 5. 1). What this alliance brought to Solomon (1
Kings 5. 6-10; 2 Chron. 2. 3-14). 2.) His relations <i>with
Egypt</i>; in commerce (1 Kings 10. 28, 29); in marriage, a
bold departure from Israelite customs (1 Kings 3. 1). Probably
Psalm 45 was written upon this event. 3.) <i>With Arabia</i>,
the land bordering on the southern end of the Red Sea (1
Kings 10. 1-10, 14, 15). 4.) <i>With India</i>, which is probably
referred to in 1 Kings 9. 26-28. 5.) <i>With Spain</i>, probably
meant in 1 Kings 10. 22.</p>

<p>5. <b>His buildings.</b> 1.) Of these the greatest, the most
costly, and the most famous was <i>the temple</i> (1 Kings 6. 1).
With this building notice: (<i>a</i>) The courts and open square,
with an inner court inside for the priests only (2 Chron 4. 9).
(<i>b</i>) The porch (2 Chron 3. 4). (<i>c</i>) The holy place (2 Chron.
3. 8; 1 Kings 6. 17). (<i>d</i>) The holy of holies (1 Kings 6. 19,
20). (<i>e</i>) The chambers for the priests (1 Kings 6. 5, 6). 2.)
<i>His own palace</i>, situated south of the temple precincts, in the
district called Ophel. Its name derived from its columned
entrance (1 Kings 7. 1, 2). 3.) <i>His fortified cities</i> (1 Kings
9. 17-19). 4.) <i>His aqueducts</i>, some of which may still be seen
(Eccl. 2. 4-6). No King of Israel ever built so many public
works as did Solomon.</p>

<p>6. But all was not bright in the reign of Solomon. We
must notice also <b>his sins</b>, for they wrought great results of
evil in the after years. 1.) That which led to all his other
sins was <i>foreign marriages</i> (1 Kings 11. 1-4). These
were the natural and inevitable result of his foreign relations,
and were probably effected for political reasons as well as to
add to the splendor of his court. 2.) His <i>toleration of idolatry</i>,
perhaps actual participation in it (1 Kings 11. 5-8). We
cannot over-estimate the harm of Solomon's influence in this
direction. At once it allied him with the lower and evil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
elements in the nation, and lost to him the sympathy of all the
earnest souls.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> 3.) Another of Solomon's sins, not named in
Scripture, but referred to in many legends of the East, was
his <i>devotion to magical arts</i>. He appears in Oriental traditions
as the great master of forces in the invisible world, engaging
in practices forbidden by the law of Moses (Lev. 19. 31;
Deut. 18. 10, 11).</p>

<p>II. <b>GENERAL ASPECTS OF ISRAEL IN THE
REIGN OF SOLOMON.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>It was a period of peace.</b> For sixty years there
were no wars. This gave opportunity for development, for
wealth, and for culture.</p>

<p>2. <b>It was a period of strong government.</b> The age of
individual and tribal energy was ended, and now all the life of
the nation was gathered around the throne. All the tribes were
held under one strong hand; tribal lines were ignored in the
government of the empire (1 Kings 4. 7-19); every department
was organized.</p>

<p>3. <b>It was a period of wide empire.</b> It was Israel's opportunity
for power in the East; for the old Chaldean empire
had broken up, the new Assyrian empire had not arisen,
and Egypt was passing through a change of rulers and was
weak. For one generation Israel held the supremacy in the
Oriental world.</p>

<p>4. <b>It was a period of abundant wealth.</b> (1 Kings 3.
12, 13; 4. 20; 10. 23, 27.) The sources of this wealth were:
1.) The <i>conquests</i> of David, who had plundered many nations
and left his accumulated riches to Solomon (1 Chron.
22. 14-16). 2.) The <i>tribute</i> of the subject kingdoms, doubtless
heavy (1 Kings 10. 25). 3.) <i>Commerce</i> with foreign
countries, Egypt, Arabia, Tarshish, and Ophir, in ancient
times was not carried on by private enterprise, but by the
government. The <i>trade</i> of the East from Egypt and Tyre
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>passed through Solomon's dominions, enriching the land.
4.) There were also <i>taxes</i> laid upon the people (1 Kings 4. 7;
12. 4). 5.) The erection of <i>public buildings</i> must have enriched
many private citizens and made money plenty.</p>

<p>5. <b>It was a period of literary activity.</b> The books
written during this epoch were Samuel, Psalms (in part),
Proverbs (in part), and perhaps Ecclesiastes and Solomon's
Song. Not all the writings of Solomon have been preserved
(1 Kings 4. 32, 33).</p>

<p>III. <b>DANGERS OF THE PERIOD.</b> There was an
Arabian tradition that in Solomon's staff, on which he leaned,
there was a worm secretly gnawing it asunder. So there were
elements of destruction under all the splendor of Solomon's
throne.</p>

<p>1. <b>The absolute power of the king.</b> David had maintained
the theocratic constitution of the state; Solomon set
it aside and ruled with absolute power in all departments. He
assumed priestly functions (1 Kings 8. 22, 54, 64); he abolished
tribal boundaries in his administration (1 Kings 4. 7-19);
he ignored both priests and prophets, and concentrated
all rule in his own person.</p>

<p>2. <b>The formal character of the worship.</b> There was
a magnificent temple and a gorgeous ritual, but none of the
warmth and personal devotion which characterized the worship
of David. The fervor of the Davidic psalms is wanting
in the literature of Solomon's age.</p>

<p>3. <b>Luxury and corruption of morals.</b> These are the
inevitable results of abundant riches and worldly association.
We do not need the warnings in Prov. 2. 16-19; 5. 3-6, etc., to
know that a flood of immorality swept over Jerusalem and Israel.</p>

<p>4. <b>The burden of taxation.</b> With a splendid court, an
immense harem, and a wealthy nobility came high prices and
high taxes; the rich growing richer rapidly, the poor becoming
poorer. The events of the next reign show how heavy
and unendurable these burdens grew.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <b>Heathen customs.</b> With the foreign peoples came
the toleration of idolatry, its encouragement, and all the abominations
connected with it. Jeroboam could not have established
his new religion (1 Kings 12. 28) if Solomon had not
already patronized idol-worship.</p>

<p>6. Underlying all was the old <b>tribal jealousy</b> of Ephraim
and Judah, fostered by an able leader (1 Kings 11. 26), ready
to break out in due time, and to destroy the empire.</p>

<p>After all, it is uncertain whether the reign of Solomon was
a golden or only a gilded age.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RIVAL THRONES.&mdash;ISRAEL.</div>


<p>The splendors of Solomon's reign passed away even more
suddenly than they arose. In less than a year after his death
his empire was broken up, and two quarreling principalities
were all that was left of Israel.</p>

<p>I. Let us ascertain the <b>CAUSES OF THE DIVISION
OF ISRAEL</b>. These were:</p>

<p>1. <b>The oppressive government of Solomon.</b> (1 Kings
12. 3, 4.) How far the complaints of the people were just,
and to what degree they were the pretexts of an ambitious
demagogue, we have no means of knowing. But it is evident
that the government of Solomon, with its court, its palaces,
its buildings, and its splendor, must have borne heavily upon
the people. Probably, also, the luxury of living among the
upper classes, so suddenly introduced, led to financial crises
and stringency of money, for which the government was held
responsible by the discontented people.</p>

<p>2. <b>The opposition of the prophets.</b> (1 Kings 11. 11-13,
29-33.) It is a suggestive fact that the prophets were opposed
to Solomon and friendly to Jeroboam. Their reason
was a strong resentment to the foreign alliances, foreign customs,
and especially to the foreign idolatries which Solomon
introduced.</p>

<p>3. <b>Foreign intrigues</b>, especially in Egypt. The old
kingdoms were not friendly to this Israelite empire, which
loomed up so suddenly, and threatened to conquer all the
East. Solomon's attempt to win the favor of Egypt by a royal
marriage (1 Kings 3. 1) was a failure, for two enemies of Solomon,
driven out of his dominions, found refuge in Egypt,
were admitted to the court, married relatives of the king, and
stirred up conspiracies against Solomon's throne (1 Kings 11.
14-22, 40). Another center of conspiracy was Damascus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
where Rezon kept up a semi-independent relation to Solomon's
empire (1 Kings 11. 23-25).</p>

<p>4. <b>Tribal jealousy</b>; the old sore broken out again.
Notice that Jeroboam belonged to the haughty tribe of Ephraim
(1 Kings 11. 26), always envious of Judah, and restless
under the throne of David. The kingdom of the ten tribes
was established mainly through the influence of this tribe.</p>

<p>5. <b>The ambition of Jeroboam</b> was another force in the
disruption. It was unfortunate for Solomon's kingdom that
the ablest young man of that time in Israel, a wily political
leader and an unscrupulous partisan, belonged to the tribe
of Ephraim, and from his environment was an enemy of the
then existing government. The fact that he was sent for
from Egypt to the assembly at Shechem showed collusion
and preparation of the scheme (1 Kings 12. 2, 3).</p>

<p>6. But even all these causes might have been insufficient
but for <b>the folly of Rehoboam</b> (1 Kings 12. 13, 14). If
David had been on the throne that day an empire might have
been saved. But Rehoboam, brought up in the purple, was
without sympathy with the people, tried to act the part of a
tyrant, and lost his ancestral realm (1 Kings 12. 16).</p>

<p>II. <b>THE RESULTS OF THE DIVISION.</b> These
were partly political, partly religious, and were neither of unmixed
good nor unmixed evil.</p>

<p>1. The <b>political results</b> were: 1.) The entire <i>disruption</i>
of Solomon's empire. Five kingdoms took the place of one;
Syria on the north, Israel in the center, Judah west of
the Dead Sea, Moab east of the Dead Sea, and Edom
on the extreme south. Moab was nominally subject to
Israel, and Edom to Judah; but only strong kings, like
Ahab in Israel and Jehoshaphat in Judah, could exact the
tribute (2 Kings 3. 4; 1 Kings 22. 47). 2.) With the
loss of empire came <i>rivalry</i>, and consequent <i>weakness</i>. For
fifty years Israel and Judah were at war, and spent their
strength in civil strife, while Syria was growing powerful,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and afar in the north-east Assyria was threatening. 3.) As
a natural result came at last <i>foreign domination</i>. Both Israel
and Judah fell under the power of other nations, and were
swept into captivity as the final result of the disruption
wrought by Jeroboam.</p>

<p>2. <b>The religious results</b> of the division were more favorable.
They were: 1.) <i>Preservation of the true religion.</i> A
great empire would inevitably have been the spiritual ruin of
Israel, for it must have been worldly, secular, and, in the end,
idolatrous. The disruption broke off relation with the world,
put an end to schemes of secular empire, and placed Israel
and Judah once more alone among their mountains. In this
sense the event was from the Lord, who had higher and more
enduring purposes than an earthly empire (1 Kings 12. 15-24).
2.) <i>Protection of the true religion.</i> Israel on the north stood
as a "buffer," warding off the world from Judah on the south.
It was neither wholly idolatrous nor wholly religious, but
was a debatable land for centuries. It fell at last, but it saved
Judah; and in Judah was the unconscious hope of the world.
3.) <i>Concentration of the true religion.</i> The departure of Israel
from the true faith led to the gathering of the priests, Levites
and worshiping element of the people in Judah (2 Chron. 11.
13-16). Thus the Jewish kingdom was far more devoted to
Jehovah than it might otherwise have been.</p>

<p>III. <b>THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL.</b> From the
division the name <i>Israel</i> was applied to the northern kingdom
and <i>Judah</i> to the southern. We notice the general
aspects of Israel during its history, from B. C. 975 to 721.</p>

<p>1. <b>Its extent.</b> It embraced all the territory of the twelve
tribes except Judah and a part of Benjamin (1 Kings 12.
19-21), held a nominal supremacy over Moab east of the
Dead Sea, and embraced about 9,375 square miles, while
Judah included only 3,435. Israel was about equal in area
to Massachusetts and Rhode Island together.</p>

<p>2. <b>Its capital</b> was at first <i>Shechem</i>, in the center of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
land (1 Kings 12. 25); then, during several reigns, at <i>Tirzah</i>
(1 Kings 15. 33; 16. 23); then at <i>Samaria</i> (1 Kings 16. 24),
where it remained until the end of the kingdom. That city
after a time gave its name to the kingdom (1 Kings 21. 1),
and after the fall of the kingdom to the province in the center
of Palestine (John 4. 3, 4).</p>

<p>3. <b>Its religion.</b> 1.) Very soon after the institution of the
new kingdom Jeroboam established a national religion, the
<i>worship of the calves</i> (1 Kings 12. 26-33). This was not a
new form of worship, but had been maintained in Israel ever
since the Exodus (Exod. 32. 1-4). In character it was a
modified idolatry, half-way between the pure religion and the
abominations of the heathen. 2.) Ahab and his house introduced
the Phenician <i>worship of Baal</i>, an idolatry of the most
abominable and immoral sort (1 Kings 16. 30-33), but it never
gained control in Israel, and was doubtless one cause of
the revolution which placed another family on the throne.
3.) Through the history of Israel there remained a remnant
of <i>worshipers of Jehovah</i>, who were watched over by a noble
array of prophets, and though often persecuted remained
faithful (1 Kings 19. 14, 18).</p>

<p>4. <b>Its rulers.</b> During two hundred and fifty years Israel
was governed by nineteen kings, with intervals of anarchy.
Five houses in turn held sway, each established by a usurper,
generally a soldier, and each dynasty ending in a murder.</p>

<p>1.) <i>The House of Jeroboam</i> (B. C. 974 to 953), with two
kings, followed by a general massacre of Jeroboam's family
(1 Kings 15. 29, 30).</p>

<p>2.) <i>The House of Baasha</i> (B. C. 953-929), two kings, followed
by a civil war (1 Kings 16. 16-22).</p>

<p>3.) <i>The House of Omri</i> (B. C. 929-884), four kings, of whom
Omri and Ahab were the most powerful. This was the age
of the prophet Elijah and the great struggle between the worship
of Jehovah and of Baal (1 Kings 18. 4-21).</p>

<p>4.) <i>The House of Jehu</i> (B. C. 884-772), five kings, under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
whom were great changes of fortune. The reign of Jehoahaz
saw Israel reduced to a mere province of Syria (2 Kings 13.
1-9). His son Joash threw off the Syrian yoke, and <i>his</i> son,
Jeroboam II., raised Israel almost to its condition of empire
in the days of Solomon (2 Kings 14. 23-29). His reign is
called "the Indian summer of Israel."</p>

<p>5.) <i>The House of Menahem</i> (B. C. 772-759), two reigns. Israel
had by this time fallen under the power of Assyria, now
dominant over the East, and its history is the story of kings
rising and falling in rapid succession, with long intervals of
anarchy. From the fall of this dynasty there was only the
semblance of a state until the final destruction of Samaria,
B. C. 721.</p>

<p>5. <b>Its foreign relations.</b> During the period of the Israelite
kingdom we see lands struggling for the dominion of the
East. The history of Israel is interwoven with that of Syria
and Assyria, which may now be read from the monuments.</p>

<p>1.) There was a <i>Period of Division</i> (B. C. 975-929). During
the reign of the houses of Jeroboam and Baasha there were
constant wars between Israel, Syria, and Judah; and as a result
all were kept weak, and "a balance of power" was maintained.</p>

<p>2.) Then followed a <i>Period of Alliance</i> (B. C. 929-884)&mdash;that
is, between Israel and Judah, during the sway of the
House of Omri. The two lands were in friendly relations,
and the two thrones were connected by marriages. As
a result both Israel and Judah were strong, Moab and
Edom were kept under control, and Syria was held in check.</p>

<p>3.) Next came the <i>Period of Syrian Ascendency</i> (B. C.
884-840). During the first two reigns of the House of Jehu
Syria rose to great power tinder Hazael, and overran both
Israel and Judah. At one time Israel was in danger of utter
destruction, but was preserved. Near the close of these periods
the dying prophecy of Elisha was uttered (2 Kings 13.
14-25).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>4.) <i>The Period of Israelite Ascendency</i> (B. C. 840-772). Israel
under Jeroboam II. took its turn of power, and for a
brief period was again dominant to the Euphrates, as in the
days of Solomon.</p>

<p>5.) <i>The Period of Assyrian Ascendency</i> (B. C. 772-721). But
its glory soon faded away before that of Assyria, which was
now rapidly becoming the empire of the East. Its rise meant
the fall of Israel; and under the unfortunate Hoshea Samaria
was taken, what was left of the ten tribes were carried
captive, and the kingdom of Israel was extinguished (2 Kings
17. 1-6).</p>

<p>IV. <b>THE FATE OF THE TEN TRIBES.</b> There
has been much idle discussion over this subject and some
absurd claims set up; for example, that the Anglo-Saxon race
are descended from the ten lost tribes&mdash;a statement opposed to
all history, to ethnology, and to every evidence of language.</p>

<p>1. After their deposition nearly all the Israelites, having
lost their national religion and having no bond of union,
<b>mingled with the Gentiles</b> around them and lost their
identity, just as hundreds of other races have done. The
only bond which will keep a nation long alive is that of
religion.</p>

<p>2. Some remained in Palestine, others returned thither and
formed the <b>nucleus of the Samaritan people</b>, a race of
mingled origin (2 Kings 17. 24-29).</p>

<p>3. Some of those who remained in the East retained their
religion, or were revived in it, and later became a part of the
<b>Jews of the dispersion</b>; though "the dispersion" was
mainly Jewish, and not Israelite.</p>

<p>4. A few <b>families united with the Jews</b> returned with
them to Palestine after the exile, yet retained their tribal
relationship; for example, Anna (Luke 2. 36).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE RIVAL THRONES&mdash;JUDAH.</div>


<p>I. <b>GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE KINGDOM
OF JUDAH.</b></p>

<p>1. <b>Its territory.</b> It embraced the mountain portion of
the tribe of Judah, from the Dead Sea to the Philistine plain;
a part of Benjamin, in which tribe the larger part of Jerusalem
stood; and also a part of Dan (2 Chron. 11. 10). Simeon
was nominally within its border, but was practically given up
to the Arabians of the desert; Edom was tributary, though
often in rebellion, and finally independent (1 Kings 22. 47;
2 Kings 8. 20); Philistia was outside of its boundary. Its
extent was about 3,435 square miles, about half the area of
Massachusetts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i-077-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-077.jpg" width="400" height="284" alt="JUDAH." title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>2. <b>Its government</b> was a monarchy, with but one family
on the throne, the line of David, in direct succession, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the exception of Athaliah's usurpation (2 Kings 11. 1-3),
through nineteen reigns.</p>

<p>3. <b>Its religion.</b> Through all the history we find two
forms of worship strongly opposed to each other, yet both
rooted in the nation. 1.) The worship of Jehovah through
the temple, the priesthood, and the prophets. 2.) But side
by side with this pure religion was the worship of idols upon
"high places," probably begun as a form of worshiping
Jehovah, but degenerating into gross and immoral idolatry.
There was a struggle going on constantly between these two
elements in the state, the spiritual and the material. Notwithstanding
the efforts of reforming kings like Jehoshaphat,
Hezekiah, and Josiah, the general tendency was downward.</p>

<p>II. <b>THE DURATION OF THE KINGDOM.</b> The
kingdom lasted from B. C. 975 to 587&mdash;more than one hundred
and thirty years longer than Israel. Reasons for its
endurance may have been:</p>

<p>1. <b>Its retired situation</b>: hemmed in by mountains and
deserts; at a distance from the ordinary lines of travel; not
in the direct path of conquest from any other nation. Judah
had few foreign wars as compared with Israel.</p>

<p>2. <b>The unity of its people.</b> They were not ten tribes
loosely connected, but one tribe, with a passionate love of their
nation and a pride in their blood.</p>

<p>3. <b>Its concentration at Jerusalem.</b> Through all its
history there was but one capital, where the palace of the
king and the temple of the Lord were standing together.</p>

<p>4. <b>The reverence for the House of David</b> also kept
the people together. There was no change in dynasty, and
the loyalty of the people grew stronger through the generations
toward the family on the throne. There being no usurpers,
the throne was permanent until destroyed by foreign
power.</p>

<p>5. <b>The purity of its religion</b> tended to keep the nation
united, and to keep it in existence. No bond of self-interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
or of blood will hold a people together as strongly as the tie
of religion. Judah's strength was in the measure of her
service of God, and when she renounced Jehovah her doom
came speedily.</p>

<p>III. <b>PERIODS IN THE HISTORY.</b> Though Judah
was not without political contact with other nations, yet its
history is the record of internal events rather than external
relations. We may divide its history into four epochs:</p>

<p>1. <b>The first decline and revival.</b> (B. C. 975-889.)
1.) The reigns of Rehoboam and Abijah marked a decline
indicated by the Egyptian invasion and the growth of idolatry.
2.) The reign of Asa and Jehoshaphat showed a revival in
reformation, progress, and power. Under Jehoshaphat Judah
was at the height of prosperity. This was the time of peace
with Israel, and of strength at home and abroad (2 Chron.
17. 5; 20. 30).</p>

<p>2. <b>The second decline and revival.</b> (B. C. 889-682.)
1.) For nearly two hundred years after the death of Jehoshaphat
the course of Judah was downward. Edom was lost
under Jehoram (2 Chron. 21. 8); the Baalite idolatry was introduced
by the usurping queen, Athaliah (2 Kings 11. 18);
the land was again and again invaded under Joash and Amaziah,
and Jerusalem itself was taken and plundered. 2.) But
a great reformation was wrought under Hezekiah, who was
the best and wisest of the kings of Judah, and the kingdom
again rose to power, even daring to throw off the Assyrian
yoke and defy the anger of the mightiest king then on the
earth. At this time came the great event of the destruction
of the Assyrian host (2 Kings 19. 30).</p>

<p>3. <b>The third decline and revival.</b> (B. C. 682-610.)
1.) The reforms of Hezekiah were short lived, for his son
Manasseh was both the longest in reigning and the wickedest
of the kings, and his late repentance did not stay the tide
of corruption which he had let loose (2 Kings 21. 10-17; 2
Chron. 33. 1-18). The wickedness of Manasseh's reign was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the great moral cause of the kingdom's destruction, for from
it no reform afterward could lift the mass of the people. 2.)
Josiah, the young reformer, attempted the task, but his efforts,
though earnest, were only measurably successful, and after
his untimely death the kingdom hastened to its fall (2 Kings
23. 29).</p>

<p>4. <b>The final decline and fall.</b> (B. C. 610-587.) 1.) The
political cause of the destruction of the kingdom was the
rise of Babylon. The old Assyrian empire went down about
625 B. C., and a struggle followed between Babylon and
Egypt for the supremacy. Judah took the side of Egypt,
which proved to be the losing side. 2.) After several chastisements
and repeated rebellions Jerusalem was finally destroyed
by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, and the kingdom of
Judah was extinguished, B. C. 587.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE CAPTIVITY OF JUDAH.</div>


<p>I. We must distinguish between the <b>CAPTIVITY OF
ISRAEL</b>, or the ten tribes, and <b>THAT OF JUDAH</b>.</p>

<p>1. The captivity of Israel took place B. C. 721, that of Judah
B. C. 587. The southern kingdom lasted one hundred
and thirty-four years longer than the northern.</p>

<p>2. Israel was taken captive by the Assyrians under Sargon;
Judah by the Chaldeans under Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>3. Israel was taken to the lands south of the Caspian Sea
(2 Kings 17. 6); Judah to Chaldea, by the river Euphrates
(Psa. 137. 1).</p>

<p>4. Israel never returned from its captivity, which was the
end of its history; but Judah was brought back from its
captivity and again became a flourishing state, though subject
to foreign nations during most of its after history.</p>

<p>II. There were <b>THREE CAPTIVITIES</b> of Judah,
all in one generation and all under one Chaldean king, Nebuchadnezzar:</p>

<p>1. <b>Jehoiakim's captivity.</b> (B. C. 607.) Jehoiakim was
the son of Josiah, placed upon the throne after the battle of
Megiddo, in which Josiah perished (2 Kings 23. 34). In the
war between Pharaoh-nechoh of Egypt and Nebuchadnezzar
(then joint king of Babylon with his father Nabopolassar)
Jehoiakim, as a vassal of Nechoh, aided the Egyptians. After
the defeat of Nechoh, Nebuchadnezzar marched to punish Jehoiakim.
He was called away from the siege of Jerusalem
by the death of his father and the necessity of hastening to
Babylon to assume the government. Jehoiakim was spared,
but a number of the nobles of Judah were taken to Babylon,
perhaps as hostages for the king's good conduct. For three
years Jehoiakim obeyed Nebuchadnezzar; then he rebelled,
but was speedily reduced to subjection, and many of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
leading people among the Jews were carried captive to Babylon
(2 Kings 24. 1, 2). Among these captives was Daniel
the prophet (Dan. 1. 1-6). From this event the <i>seventy years</i>
of the captivity were dated (Jer. 27. 22; 29. 10), though the
kingdom of Judah remained for twenty years longer. Jehoiakim,
the king, was not taken away, though bound in chains
for that purpose (2 Chron. 36. 6); he reigned several years
after this event, but under suspicion of the Chaldeans, and his
end was ignoble (Jer. 22. 18, 19; 36. 30).</p>

<p>2. <b>Jehoiachin's captivity.</b> (B. C. 598.) Jehoiachin
was the son of Jehoiakim (called Jeconiah, 1 Chron 3. 16;
Jer. 24. 1; and Coniah, Jer. 22. 24). He reigned only three
months, and was then deposed by Nebuchadnezzar and carried
to Babylon. With the young king and the royal family
were taken thousands of the people of the middle classes,
whom the land could ill spare (2 Kings 24. 8-16). Among
these captives was Ezekiel, the prophet-priest (Ezek. 1. 1-3).</p>

<p>3. <b>Zedekiah's captivity.</b> (B. C. 587.) He was the
uncle of Jehoiachin, and the son of the good Josiah (2 Kings
24. 17), and had been made king by Nebuchadnezzar. But
he too rebelled against his master, to whom he had taken a
solemn oath of fidelity (2 Chron. 36. 13). The Chaldeans
were greatly incensed by these frequent insurrections, and determined
upon a final destruction of the rebellious city. After
a long siege Jerusalem was taken, and the king was captured
while attempting flight. He was blinded and carried away
to Babylon, the city was destroyed, and nearly all the people
left alive were also taken to the land of Chaldea (2 Kings 25.
1-11). After this captivity the city lay desolate for fifty
years, until the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus (B. C. 536).</p>

<p>III. Let us ascertain the <b>CAUSES OF THE CAPTIVITY</b>;
why the Jews were taken up bodily from their
own land and deported to a distant country.</p>

<p>1. Such deportations were a frequent <b>policy of Oriental
conquerors</b>. The Orientals had three ways of dealing with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a conquered people: that of extermination or wholesale
butchery, which is frequently described upon the Assyrian
monuments; that of leaving them in the land under tribute,
as subjects of the conqueror; and that of deporting them <i>en
masse</i> to a distant land. Frequently, when the interests of the
empire would be served by changing the population of a province,
this plan was carried out. Thus the ten tribes were carried
to a land near the Caspian Sea, and other people were
brought to Samaria in their place (2 Kings 17. 6, 24). A
similar plan with respect to Judah was proposed by Sennacherib
(2 Kings 18. 31, 32), but was thwarted by the destruction
of the Assyrian host.</p>

<p>2. We have already noticed another cause of the captivity
in the frequent <b>rebellions of the kings of Judah</b> against
the authority of Babylon. The old spirit of independence,
which had made Judah the leader of the twelve tribes, was
still strong, and it was fostered by the hope of universal rule,
which had been predicted through centuries, even while the
kingdom was declining. The prophets, however, favored
submission to Babylon; but the nobles urged rebellion and
independence. Their policy was pursued, and the unequal
strife was taken up more than once. The rebellions always
failed; but after several attempts the patience of Nebuchadnezzar
was exhausted, and the destruction of the rebellious
city and the deportation of the population was ordered.</p>

<p>3. But underneath was another and a deeper cause&mdash;in <b>the
rivalry of Egypt and Babylon</b>. Whenever in history one
nation has been dominant there has been another nation,
next in strength, as its rival to check its supremacy. Thus
Greece stood in the way of Persia, Carthage in the way of republican
Rome, and Parthia in the way of imperial Rome. In
the earlier days Assyria (and after Assyria Babylon) was the
controlling power in the East; but it was always opposed by
Egypt, which, though less powerful, was yet strong enough to
be dangerous to Assyrian or Chaldean supremacy. Palestine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
stood on the border of the Assyrian Empire toward Egypt;
and in Palestine there were two parties, the Assyrian and the
Egyptian; one counseling submission to Assyria, the other
seeking alliance with Egypt against Assyria (Isa. 31. 1-3; 37.
6). After Babylon took the place of Nineveh the Chaldean
party took the place of the Assyrian, as the Chaldean Empire
was the successor of the Assyrian Empire. The prophets,
led by Jeremiah, always counseled submission to Babylon, and
warned against trusting to Egypt, which had never given any
thing more than promises; but the nobles were of the Egyptian
party, and constantly influenced the kings to renounce
the yoke of Babylon, and to strike for independence by the
aid of Egypt. Under Egyptian influence the later kings of
Judah made attempt after attempt to rebel against the Chaldean
Empire. But the expected help from Egypt never came,
and Judah was left again and again to suffer the wrath of
Babylon (Jer. 37. 5-9). The necessity of making the frontier
of the Chaldean Empire safe on the side toward Egypt was
the political cause for the deportation of the tribe of Judah.
Nebuchadnezzar dared not to leave a people on the soil who
would constantly endanger the entrance to his dominions by
plotting with the Egyptians. He therefore took up the Jews
bodily, placed them in the center of his empire, and turned
the land of Judah into a desolation.</p>

<p>4. There was underlying all these political reasons a moral
cause in <b>the divine purpose to discipline the nation</b>.
The captivity was a weeding-out process, to separate the
precious from the vile, the false from the true, the "remnant"
from the mass. There had always been two distinct
elements in Israel and Judah&mdash;the spiritual, God-fearing few,
and the worldly, idol-worshiping many. The worldly and
irreligious took part in the resistance to the King of Babylon;
and the worshipers of Jehovah, led by the prophets, urged
submission. As a result, the nobles and the warriors, for the
most part, perished; while the better part, the strength and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
hope of the nation, were carried away captive. Notice that
the captives were mainly of the middle class, the working element
(2 Kings 24. 14-16). Those who had submitted to the
Chaldeans were also taken away (2 Kings 25. 11). The
prophet expressed greater hope for those taken away than for
those left behind (Jer. 24. 1-10). The captives were the root
of Judah, out of which in due time a new nation should rise.</p>

<p>IV. <b>THE CONDITION OF THE CAPTIVES
IN CHALDEA</b> was far better than we are apt to suppose.</p>

<p>1. They received <b>kind treatment</b>; were regarded not as
slaves or prisoners, but as colonists. At a later captivity by
the Romans the Jews were sold as slaves and dispersed
throughout the empire. Such wholesale enslavement was
common after a conquest. For some reason the Chaldeans
did not enslave the Jews at the time of their conquest, but
colonized them as free people. This may have been because
the captives as a class were of the "Chaldean party" among
the Jews, and hence were treated in a measure as friends.
The letter of Jeremiah to the exiles (Jer. 29. 1-7) shows that
they were kindly dealt with in Chaldea. Some of them were
received at the court and rose to high station in the realm
(Dan. 1. 1-6).</p>

<p>2. <b>Their organization was maintained.</b> The exiles
were not merged into the mass of the people where they were
living, but retained their own system, and were recognized as
a separate colony. Their dethroned kings had a semi-royal
state, and at death an honorable burial (Jer. 52. 31-34; 34.
4, 5). The captives were governed by elders, rulers of their
own nation (Ezek. 8. 1; 14. 1; 20. 1). Such a system is still
pursued in the East, where the government is according to
race as well as according to locality; that is, the different
races in one province will each have separate rulers. There
was a "prince of Judah" at the close of the captivity (Ezra
1. 8). This fact of a national organization was a fortunate
one for the exiles. If they had been dispersed as slaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
throughout the empire, or even had been scattered as individuals,
they would soon have been merged among the Gentiles,
and would have lost their identity as a people. But maintaining
as a separate race, and in Jewish communities, they
were readily gathered for a return to their own land when the
opportunity came.</p>

<p>3. <b>Their law and worship were observed.</b> There were
no sacrifices, for these could be offered only at Jerusalem in
the temple. But the people gathered for worship and for the
study of the law far more faithfully than before the exile;
for adversity is a school of religious character far more than
prosperity. The exile would naturally exert an influence in
the direction of religion. While the irreligious and idolatrous
among the captives would soon drop out of the nation and
be lost among the Gentiles, the earnest, the spiritual, and the
God-fearing would grow more intense in their devotion. The
institutions which date from the captivity (noticed below,
under "Results of Captivity") are an evidence of this fact.</p>

<p>4. <b>They were instructed by prophets and teachers.</b>
Jeremiah lived for some time after the beginning of the captivity,
made a visit to Babylon, and wrote at least one letter
to the exiles (Jer. 13. 4-7; 29. 1-3). Daniel lived during the
captivity, and, though in the court, maintained a deep interest
in his people, and comforted them by his prophecies.
Ezekiel was himself one of the captives, and all his teachings
were addressed to them (Ezek. 1. 1-3). Many evangelical
and eminent Bible scholars are of the opinion that the
latter part of Isaiah, from the fortieth chapter to the end, was
given by a "later Isaiah" during the exile; but whether
written at that time or earlier, it must have circulated among
the captives and given them new hope and inspiration. The
radical change in the character of the Jews which took place
during this period shows that a great revival swept over the
captive people and brought them back to the earnest religion
of their noblest ancestors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>5. <b>Their literature was preserved and enlarged.</b>
Internal evidence shows that the Books of the Kings were
finished and the Books of the Chronicles written at this time
or soon afterward; the Books of Daniel, Ezekiel, Habakkuk,
and other of the minor prophets were given; and a number
of the best psalms were composed during this epoch, as such
poems are likely to be written in periods of trial and sorrow.
Out of the many psalms we cite Psalms 124, 126, 129, 130,
137, as manifestly written during the captivity. The exile
was an age of life and vigor to Hebrew literature.</p>

<p>V. <b>THE RESULTS OF THE CAPTIVITY.</b>
In the year 536 B. C. the city of Babylon was taken by Cyrus,
King of the combined Medes and Persians. One of his first
acts was to issue an edict permitting the exiled Jews to return
to their own country and rebuild their city. Not all the Jews
availed themselves of the privilege, for many were already
rooted in their new homes, where they had been for two generations.
But a large number returned (Ezra 2. 64), and re-established
the city and state of the Jews. The captivity,
however, left its impress upon the people down to the end of
their national history, and even to the present time.</p>

<p>1. <b>There was a change in language</b>, from Hebrew to
Aramaic or Chaldaic. The books of the Old Testament
written after the restoration are in a different language from
the earlier writings. After the captivity the Jews needed an
interpreter in order to understand their own earlier Scriptures.
Allusion to this fact is given in Neh. 8. 7. The Chaldee
of Babylon and the Hebrew were sufficiently alike to cause
the people during two generations to glide imperceptibly from
one to the other, until the knowledge of their ancient tongue
was lost to all but the scholars.</p>

<p>2. <b>There was a change in habits.</b> Before the captivity
the Jews were a secluded people, having scarcely any
relation with the world. The captivity brought them into
contact with other nations, and greatly modified their manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of living. Hitherto they had been mostly farmers, living on
their own fields; now they became merchants and traders,
and filled the world with their commerce. Rarely now do we
find a Jew who cultivates the ground for his support. They
are in the cities, buying and selling. This tendency began
with the Babylonian captivity, and has since been strengthened
by the varied experiences, especially by the persecutions of
the Jews during the centuries.</p>

<p>3. <b>There was a change in character.</b> This was the
most radical of all. Before the captivity the crying sin of
Judah, as well as of Israel, was its tendency to idolatry.
Every prophet had warned against it and rebuked it; reformers
had risen up; kings had endeavored to extirpate, but all
in vain; the worshipers of God were the few, the worshipers
of idols were the many. After the captivity there was a
wonderful transformation. From that time we never read of
a Jew bowing his knee before an idol. The entire nation
was a unit in the service of Jehovah. Among all the warnings
of the later prophets, and the reforms of Ezra and Nehemiah,
there is no allusion to idolatry. That crime was utterly
and forever eradicated; from the captivity until to-day
the Jews have been the people of the one, invisible God, and
intense in their hatred of idols. We may not know all the
causes of this change, but some of them were: 1.) The fact that
the idolatrous element largely perished, and the spiritual element
formed the bulk of the captives. 2.) The idol-worshipers
among the captives would naturally be less loyal to the national
ideas, and would more readily assimilate with the heathen;
while the religious among the exiles would grow all the more
devoted to their religion as their only hope in trial. 3.) The
most ardent lovers of their country and their religion would be
the most eager to return after the exile; hence, the new state
was founded by zealous Jews, who gave it religious spirit. So
in modern times the spirit of the Pilgrims and the Puritans gave
tone to New England, and through New England to America.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>There were new institutions</b> as the result of the
captivity. Two great institutions arose during the captivity:</p>

<p>1.) The <i>synagogue</i>, which grew up among the exiles, was
carried back to Palestine, and was established throughout the
Jewish world. This was a meeting of Jews for worship, for
reading the law, and for religious instruction. It had far
greater influence than the temple after the captivity; for
while there was but one temple in all the Jewish world, there
was a synagogue in every city and village where Jews lived;
and while the temple was the seat of a priestly and ritualistic
service, the synagogue promoted freedom of religious thought
and utterance. Out of the synagogue, far more than the
temple, grew the Christian Church.</p>

<p>2.) <i>The order of scribes</i> was also a result of the captivity.
The days of direct inspiration through prophets were passing
away, and those of the written Scripture, with a class of men
to study and interpret it, came in their place. During the captivity
the devout Jews studied the books of their literature,
the law, the psalms, the histories, and the prophets. After the
captivity arose a series of scholars who were the expounders
of the Scriptures. Their founder was Ezra, at once a priest,
a scribe, and a prophet (Ezra 7. 1-10), who arranged the
books and in a measure completed the canon of Old Testament
Scripture.</p>

<p>5. <b>There was a new hope, that of a Messiah.</b>
From the time of the captivity the Jewish people looked
forward with eager expectation to the coming of a Deliverer,
the Consolation of Israel, the "Anointed One" (the word Messiah
means "anointed"), who should lift up his people from
the dust, exalt the throne of David, and establish an empire
over all the nations. This had been promised by prophets
for centuries before the exile, but only then did it begin to
shine as the great hope of the people. It grew brighter with
each generation, and finally appeared in the coming of Jesus
Christ, the King of Israel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>6. From the captivity there <b>were two parts of the
Jewish people</b>; the Jews of Palestine, and the Jews of the
dispersion. 1.) The Jews of Palestine, sometimes called Hebrews
(Acts 6. 1), were the lesser in number, who lived in
their own land and maintained the Jewish state. 2.) The
Jews of the dispersion were the descendants of those who
did not return after the decree of Cyrus (Ezra 1. 1), but
remained in foreign lands and gradually formed Jewish
"quarters" in all the cities of the ancient world. They were
the larger in number, and later were called "Grecian Jews,"
or Hellenists, from the language which they used (Acts 6. 1).
Between these two bodies there was a close relation. The
Jews of the dispersion had synagogues in every city (Acts
15. 1), were devoted to the law, made constant pilgrimages to
Jerusalem, and were recognized as having one hope with the
Jews of Palestine. The traits of the two bodies were different,
but each contributed its own element toward the making of a
great people.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>The Jewish Province.</div>


<p>From the return of the exiles, B. C. 536, to the final destruction
of the Jewish state by the Romans, A. D. 70, the history
of the chosen people is closely interwoven with that of the
East in general. During most of this time Judea was a subject
province, belonging to the great empires which rose and
fell in succession. For a brief but brilliant period it was an
independent state, with its own rulers. As most of this period
comes between the Old and New Testaments its events are
less familiar to Bible readers than the other portions of Israelite
history. We therefore give more space than usual to
the facts, only selecting the most important, and omitting all
that have no direct relation with the development of the divine
plan in the Jewish people.</p>

<p>I. The history divides itself into <b>FOUR PERIODS</b>, as
follows:</p>

<p>1. <b>The Persian period</b>, B. C. 536 to 330, from Cyrus to
Alexander, while the Jewish province was a part of the Persian
Empire. Very few events of these two centuries have
been recorded, but it appears to have been a period of quiet
prosperity and growth. The Jews were governed by their
high-priests under the general control of the Persian government.
The principal events of this period were:</p>

<p>1.) <i>The second temple.</i> (B. C. 535-515.) This was begun
soon after the return from exile (Ezra 3. 1, 2, 8), but was not
completed until twenty-one years afterward (Ezra 6. 15, 16).
It was smaller and less splendid than that of Solomon, but
was built upon the same plan.</p>

<p>2.) <i>Queen Esther's deliverance.</i> (B. C. 474.) This took
place, not in Judea, but in Shushan (Susa), the capital of the
Persian Empire. The king referred to as Ahasuerus was probably
Xerxes, and the events of Esther's elevation and intercession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
took place after the defeat of his invasion of Greece.
The whole story is in accord with both Persian customs and
the character of Xerxes.</p>

<p>3.) <i>Ezra's reformation.</i> (B. C. 450.) The coming to Jerusalem
of Ezra the scribe was a great event in Israelite history;
for, aided by Nehemiah, he led in a great reformation
of the people. He found them neglecting their law and following
foreign customs. He awakened an enthusiasm for the Mosaic
law, aroused the patriotism of the people, and renewed
the ancient faith. His work gave him the title of "the second
founder of Israel."</p>

<p>4.) <i>The separation of the Samaritans.</i> (B. C. 409.) For
the origin of the Samaritans, see 2 Kings 17. 22-34. They
were a mingled people, both in race and religion; but until
the captivity were permitted to worship in the temple at Jerusalem.
After the return from Babylon the Samaritans and
the Jews grew further and further apart. The Samaritans
opposed the rebuilding of the temple (Ezra 4. 9-24), and delayed
it for many years; and a century later strove to prevent
Nehemiah from building the wall of Jerusalem (Neh. 4. 2).
Finally they established a rival temple on Mount Gerizim,
and thenceforth the two races were in bitter enmity (John 4. 9).</p>

<p>5.) <i>The completion of the Old Testament canon.</i> The prophets
after the restoration were Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi;
but the author of most of the latest books was Ezra, who also
arranged the Old Testament nearly, perhaps fully, in its
present form. Thenceforward no more books were added,
and the scribe or interpreter took the place of the prophet.</p>

</div>

<p>2. <b>The Greek period.</b> (B. C. 330-166.) In the year 330
B. C. Alexander the Great won the empire of Persia in the
great battle of Arbela, by which the sovereignty of the East
was transferred from Asia to Europe, and a new chapter in
the history of the world was opened. Alexander died at the
hour when his conquests were completed, and before they
could be organized and assimilated; but the kingdoms into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
which his empire was divided were all under Greek kings,
and were all Greek in language and civilization. Judea was
on the border between Syria and Egypt, and belonged alternately
to each kingdom. We divide this period into three
subdivisions.</p>

<p>1.) <i>The reign of Alexander.</i> (B. C. 330-321.) The Jews
had been well treated by the Persian kings and remained
faithful to Darius, the last King of Persia, in his useless
struggle. Alexander marched against Jerusalem, determined
to visit upon it heavy punishment for its opposition, but (according
to tradition) was met by Jaddua, the high-priest, and
turned from an enemy to a friend of the Jews.</p>

<p>2.) <i>The Egyptian supremacy.</i> (B. C. 311-198.) In the division
of Alexander's conquests Judea was annexed to Syria,
but it soon fell into the hands of Egypt, and was governed by
the Ptolemies (Greek kings of Egypt) until 198 B. C. The
only important events of this period were the rule of Simon the
Just, an exceptionally able high-priest, about 300 B. C., and
the translation of the Old Testament into the Greek language
for the use of the Jews of Alexandria, who had lost the use
of Hebrew or Chaldee. This translation was made about 286
B. C., according to Jewish tradition, and is known as the
Septuagint version. It was regarded as an act of sacrilege
by the Palestinian Jews to translate their Holy Scriptures into
the language of heathens, and for centuries the anniversary
of the completion of the Septuagint was observed as a day of
humiliation and prayer.</p>

<p>3.) <i>The Syrian supremacy.</i> (B. C. 198-166.) About the
year 198 B. C. Judea fell into the hands of the Syrian kingdom,
also ruled by a Greek dynasty, the Seleucid&aelig;, or descendants
of Seleucus. This change of rulers brought to the
Jews a change of treatment. Hitherto they had been permitted
to live undisturbed upon their mountains, and to enjoy
a measure of liberty, both in civil and ecclesiastical matters.
But now the Syrian kings not only robbed them of their freedom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but also undertook to compel them to renounce their
religion by one of the most cruel persecutions in all history.
The temple was desecrated and left to ruin, and the worshipers
of Jehovah were tortured and slain, in the vain endeavor
to introduce the Greek and Syrian forms of idolatry among
the Jews. Heb. 11, 33-40, is supposed to refer to this persecution.
When Antiochus, the Syrian king, found that
the Jews could not be driven from their faith, he deliberately
determined to exterminate the whole nation. Uncounted
thousands of Jews were slaughtered, other thousands
were sold as slaves, Jerusalem was well nigh destroyed, the
temple was dedicated to Jupiter Olympius, and the orgies of
the Bacchanalia were substituted for the Feast of Tabernacles.
The religion of Jehovah and the race of the Jews seemed on
the verge of utter annihilation in their own land.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Maccabean period.</b> (B. C. 166-40.) But the
darkest hour precedes the day; the cruelties of the Syrians
caused a new and splendid epoch to rise upon Israel.</p>

<p>1.) <i>The revolt of Mattathias.</i> In the year 170 B. C. an aged
priest, Mattathias, unfurled the banner of independence from
the Syrian yoke. He did not at first aim for political freedom,
but religious liberty; but after winning a few victories
over the Syrian armies he began to dream of a free Jewish
state. He died in the beginning of the war, but was succeeded
by his greater son, Judas Maccabeus.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>2.) <i>Judas Maccabeus</i> gained a greater success than had
been dreamed at the beginning of the revolt. Within four
years the Jews recaptured Jerusalem and reconsecrated the
temple. (The anniversary of this event was ever after celebrated
in the Feast of Dedication, John 10. 22.) Judas ranks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in history as one of the noblest of the Jewish heroes, and deserves
a place beside Joshua, Gideon, and Samuel as a liberator
and reformer.</p>

<p>3.) <i>The Maccabean dynasty.</i> Judas refused the title of
king, but his family established a line of rulers who by degrees
assumed a royal state, and finally the royal title. In
the year 143 B. C. Jewish liberty was formally recognized,
and the Maccabean princes ruled for a time over an independent
state. Between 130 and 110 B. C. Edom, Samaria, and
Galilee were added to Judea. The latter province had been
known as "Galilee of the Gentiles" (Isa. 9. 1); but by degrees
the foreigners withdrew, and the province was occupied by
Jews who were as devoted and loyal as those of Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i-099-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-099.jpg" width="400" height="234" alt="ROMAN EMPIRE" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>4.) <i>The rise of the sects.</i> About B. C. 100 the two sects, or
schools of thought, the Pharisees and Sadducees, began to
appear, though their principles had long been working. The
Pharisees ("separatists") sought for absolute separation from
the Gentile world and a strict construction of the law of
Moses, while the Sadducees ("moralists") were liberal in their
their theories and in their lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>The Roman period.</b> (B. C. 40-A. D. 70.) It is not
easy to name a date for the beginning of the Roman supremacy
in Palestine. It began in B. C. 63, when Pompey the
Great (afterward the antagonist of Julius C&aelig;sar) was asked
to intervene between two claimants for the Jewish throne,
Hyrcanus and Aristobulus. Pompey decided for Hyrcanus,
and aided him by a Roman army. In his interest he besieged
and took Jerusalem, and then placed Hyrcanus in
power, but without the title of king. From this time the
Romans were practically, though not nominally, in control of
affairs.</p>

<p>1.) <i>Herod the Great.</i> We assign as the date of the Roman
rule 40 B. C., when Herod (son of Antipater, an Edomite,
who had been the
general of Hyrcanus)
received the title of
king from the Roman
Senate. From this
time Palestine was
regarded as a part of
the Roman Empire.
Herod was the ablest
man of his age, and
one of the most unscrupulous.
He ruled
over all Palestine,
Idumea (ancient
Edom), and the lands
south of Damascus.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<a href="images/i-100-big.jpg"><img src="images/i-100.jpg" width="304" height="400" alt="PALESTINE IN THE TIME OF CHRIST" title="" /></a>
</div>

<p>2.) <i>Herod's temple.</i>
Herod was thoroughly
hated by the Jews,
less for his character
than for his foreign birth. To gain their favor he began rebuilding
the temple upon a magnificent scale. It was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
completed until long after his death, which took place at
Jericho about the time when Jesus Christ, the true King of
the Jews, was born (Matt. 2. 1, 2).</p>

<p>3.) <i>The tetrarchies.</i> By Herod's will his dominions were
divided into four tetrarchies ("quarter-rulings," a title for a
fourth part of a kingdom). Three of these were in Palestine&mdash;Archelaus
receiving Judea, Idumea, and Samaria; Antipas
(the Herod of Luke 4. 19, 20; 23. 7-11) receiving Galilee
and Perea; and Philip (Luke 3. 1) having the district of Bashan.
About A. D. 6 Archelaus was deposed, and a Roman,
Coponius, was appointed the first Procurator of Judea, which
was made a part of the prefecture of Syria. The rest of Jewish
annals belongs properly to the New Testament history.</p>

<p>II. Through these periods we notice the gradual <b>PREPARATION
FOR THE GOSPEL</b>, which was steadily
advancing.</p>

<p>1. <b>There was a political preparation.</b> Six centuries
before Christ the world around the Mediterranean was divided
into states, whose normal condition was war. At no
time was peace prevalent over all the world at once. If Christ
had come at that time it would have been impossible to establish
the Gospel except through war and conquest. But kingdoms
were absorbed into empires, empires rose and fell by
turns, each with a larger conception of the nation than its
predecessor. From the crude combination of undigested
states in the Assyrian Empire to the orderly, assimilated, systematic
condition of the Roman world was a great advance.
Christ appeared at the only point in the world's history when
the great nations of the world were under one government,
with a system of roads such that a traveler could pass from
Mesopotamia to Spain and could sail the Mediterranean Sea
in perfect safety.</p>

<p>2. <b>There was a preparation of language.</b> The conquests
of Alexander, though accomplished in ten years, left a
deeper impress upon the world than any other two centuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of history. They gave to the whole of that world one language,
the noblest tongue ever spoken by human lips, "a
language fit for the gods," as men said. Through Alexander
Greek cities were founded every-where in the East, Greek
kingdoms were established, the Greek literature and the Greek
civilization covered all the lands. That was the language in
which Paul preached the Gospel, and in which the New Testament
was written&mdash;the only language of the ancient world
in which the thoughts of the Gospel could be readily expressed.
While each land had its own tongue, the Greek
tongue was common in all lands.</p>

<p>3. While these preparations were going on there was another
in progress at the same time, <b>the preparation of a race</b>.
We might point to the history of the Israelites from the migration
of Abraham as a training; but we refer now to their
special preparation for their mission after the restoration,
B. C. 536. There was a divine purpose in the division of Judaism
into two streams; one a little fountain in Palestine, the
other a river dispersed over all the lands. Each branch had
its part in the divine plan. One was to concentrate its energies
upon the divine religion, to study the sacred books, to
maintain a chosen people, whose bigotry, narrowness, and intolerance
kept them from destruction; the other branch
was out in the world, where every Jewish synagogue in a
heathen city kept alive the knowledge of God, and disseminated
that knowledge, drawing around it the thoughtful,
spiritual minds who were looking for something better than
heathenism. Palestine gave the Gospel, but the Jews of the
dispersion carried it to the Gentiles, and each synagogue in
the foreign world became the nucleus of a Christian Church,
where for the first time Jew and Gentile met as equals.</p>

<p>4. Finally, there was the <b>preparation of a religion</b>.
The Gospel of Christ was not a new religion; it was the new
development of an old religion. As we study the Old Testament
we see that each epoch stands upon a higher religious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
plane. There is an enlargement of spiritual vision between
Abraham and Moses; between Moses and David; between
David and Isaiah; between Isaiah and John the Baptist.
Pharisee and Sadducee each held a share of the truth which
embraced the best thought of both sects. The work of many
scribes prepared the way for the coming of the Lord, and
just when revelation was brought up to the highest level,
when a race was trained to apprehend and proclaim it, when
a language had been created and diffused to express it, when
the world was united in one great brotherhood of states, ready
to receive it&mdash;then, in the fullness of times, the Christ was
manifested, who is over all, God blessed forever.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
